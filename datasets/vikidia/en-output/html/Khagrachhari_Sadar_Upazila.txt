Administrative area


History
In 180, the British government declared the hilly region as a hilly region. Before the partition of Pak-India, this region was a part of the state of Tripura. The British later occupied the area and established their rule. At that time Khagrachhari was known as subdivision. Until 1973, the area was included in the Chittagong Hill Tracts District with two subdivisions, Ramgarh and Khagrachhari. During the British rule, Khagrachhari was known as 1 Union. In 1987, Khagrachhari was upgraded to a police station. As a police station, activities have been conducted for a long time. The Thana Executive Officer manages all the development and administrative activities of the Thana. As a result of decentralization of the government, upazila system was introduced in 1982 instead of police station. It was then transformed from a police station to an upazila.
