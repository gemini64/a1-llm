Some old coins
The Danish krone (kr.) is the currency of Denmark, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Krone (plural kroner) means literally crown. One krone is divided into 100 Ã¸re. The Danish krone is introduced in 1875.
Although all EU members have to adopt the euro, there is a exception for Denmark (and the United Kingdom). Adopting the euro is favoured by many parties, but a referendum in 2000 showed 53% of the Danes didn't want to join the Eurozone. The Danish krone is connected in some way to the euro, but the euro isn't excepted in Denmark nor is the krone excepted in other European nations.
