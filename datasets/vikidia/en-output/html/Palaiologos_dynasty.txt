The tetragrammatic banner, emblem of the Palaiologos dynasty.
Palaiologos dynasty was a Byzantine dynasty that ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1261 until 1453. It was the last Byzantine dynasty.
Its first representative was Michael VIII Palaiologos and its last representative was Constantine XI Palaiologos. The family remained at the head of the Despotate of Morea until 1460, when its representatives were exiled after the fall of the Despotate. The last direct representative of the dynasty,  Andreas Palaiologos, died childless in 1502. The other Palaiologos disappear from the sources.
Today, Greek or Romanian personalities bear the name of Palaiologos; it is possible that they are descendants of Byzantine emperors.
