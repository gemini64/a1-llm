Gatekeeping is when a social group tries to control membership of the group and restricts its membership.
It is usually used in the context of clubs, fanbases, organizations, hobbies, interests, etc.

Positives
Gatekeeping can create a strong in-group identity and can be used to stop interests or groups from becoming mainstream and from a group becoming too open to casual members.

Negatives
Gatekeeping can foster an environment of elitism and can cause a group to deteriorate as it loses members if it gatekeeps too hard.
