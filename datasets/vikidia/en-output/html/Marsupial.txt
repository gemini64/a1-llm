Several marsupials.
The Marsupial is a mammalian. All extant marsupials are to Australasia and the Americas. The young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, opossums, wombats and Tasmanian devils.

Birth
Marsupials give birth to a live but relatively undeveloped fetus called a joey. When the joey is born it crawls from inside the mother to the pouch. Inside the pouch, the blind offspring attaches itself to one of the mother's teats and remains attached for as long as it takes to grow and develop to a juvenile stage.
