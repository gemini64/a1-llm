Yazid I
Yazid ibn Mu'awiya ibn Abu Sufyan (646 â€“ 11 November 683), also known as Yazid I was the second Caliph of the Umayyad dynasty and reigned for only three years between 680 and 683. As his name implies, he was a son of Mu'awiya I and a grandson of Abu Sufyan. His mother Maysun was Christian.
His reign was marked by two revolts, the most important of which was the revolt of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. In the Battle of Karbala (Second Fitna), the troops of Yazid Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, defeated. This ultimately proved to be a Pyrrhic victory, as many believers lost faith in this ruler who was up against a grandson of the prophet.
