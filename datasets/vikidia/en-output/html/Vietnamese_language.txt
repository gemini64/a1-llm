Vietnamese (in Vietnamese: Tiếng Việt) is the native language of Vietnam.  It is a tonal language, which means that one word can have different meanings, depending upon how it is pronounced.  Unlike most other languages in Asia (with the exceptions of Indonesian and Malaysian), Vietnamese is written in the Latin alphabet (or Roman alphabet).   The written language is based on French, but as if it was written with chinese characters - a type of writing called Chữ Nôm.
As of the last official census in Vietnam, there were approximately 75 million speakers who used Vietnamese as their first language.
