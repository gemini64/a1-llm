A beach is a place near the ocean where people swim. A beach is mainly made of sand but also sometimes of pebbles. There is also a beach with rocks, there you can find rock pools: little puddles left in between the rocks from high tide. Many children like to make sand castles or other suctures made out of sand on the beach.
