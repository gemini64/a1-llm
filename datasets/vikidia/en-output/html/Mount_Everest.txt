Mount Everest's peak
Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. It is located between Nepal and Tibet (part of China) in the Himalayas. Mount Everest is 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) high. (*)
You need a cylinder of gas because the air is so thin. Mount Everest is growing every year, about one centimetre every year.
