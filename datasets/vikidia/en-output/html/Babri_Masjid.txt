Babri Masjid
Babri Masjid was an ancient mosque located in Ayodhya, India. It was built in 1528-29 by Commander Mir Baki on the orders of Mughal Emperor Babur. The mosque was destroyed in 1992, leading to communal riots across India. The destruction was a result of a long-standing dispute between Hindus and Muslims over the ownership of the site, which is believed to be the birthplace of Rama. The Allahabad High Court ruled in 2010 that the land should be divided equally between the Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara, and Ramlala. However, on November 9, 2019, the High Court overturned the lower court's verdict and declared that the entire 2.77-acre land should be given to a trust that would build a Hindu temple, with the government providing an alternative 5 acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board to construct a mosque.
