Mozart is one of the most famous composers
A composer is a person who creates music. Most often, he or she writes scores, which instrumentalists will then play during the recording of an album or during a concert. But, since the 2000s, MAO (computer-assisted music) software has made it possible to directly create pieces from pre-recorded sounds.
