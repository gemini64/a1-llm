Technical problem
When the Xbox 360 was introduced to the market in 2005. Then, in some places, the problem of not doing it properly started appearing.
Due to this type of trouble, Microsoft extended the warranty of Xbox 360 to 3 years. The first version of the Xbox 360 S was showing this error. This error is displayed under the name General Hardware Failure General Hardware Failure. But this error is more commonly known as Red Ring of Death. Subsequently, in April 2009, its warranty was further extended. Because there was another error with the name E74. But this warranty is not given for any errors other than this.
After suffering so much trouble, Microsoft made another kind of change for it. This then gave room for heat-dispersion. Apart from this, its edge was also bended. After this change, the Xbox 360 S was brought into the market. This and any subsequent versions did not offer a 3-year warranty. To protect it from overheating, a red light was used in a button that let the user know when to let it cool down when it was overheating.
