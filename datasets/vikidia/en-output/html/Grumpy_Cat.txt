Grumpy Cat at 2014 appearance
Grumpy Cat  is a famous cat on the internet. Her real name is Tardar Sauce. She became popular because she always looks unhappy or "grumpy". (*)
Her owner says that her grumpy-looking face is due to feline dwarfism and the placement of her teeth in her mouth. (*)

History
Grumpy Cat lives with her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, in Morristown, Arizona.
She was born on April 4, 2012, with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail". Her mom is a calico short haired cat, and her father has grey and white stripes. Tardar Sauce is small for her breed, and has hind legs that "are a bit different". Even though she has a grumpy expression all the time, she is calm and "actually really nice". Her brother, Pokey, who was born in the same litter, has the grumpy personality.
Her owners say Tardar Sauce is a normal cat "99% of the time". She is only allowed to have photos taken once a week. She cannot be handled by people she does not know very often.

Popularity
Grumpy Cat first became famous when Tabatha's brother posted some photos of her on Reddit, the social-news site. (*)  Then, other users made photoshopped parodies of the unhappy cat with grumpy sayings, such as: ‘I had fun once. It was awful’ and ‘Just put me down’.
Grumpy Cat has her own website. She has a Facebook page. She has a manager, Ben Lashes. He also represents Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat. (*)  There are stuffed toy cats of her, t-shirts, calendars and mugs available for sale in stores and online. Many are featured on her website.
She appeared at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas in 2013. She was shown in limited two-hour appearances every day.
Grumpy Cat was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on May 30, 2013, and on the cover of New York magazine on October 7, 2013. (*)  (*)
