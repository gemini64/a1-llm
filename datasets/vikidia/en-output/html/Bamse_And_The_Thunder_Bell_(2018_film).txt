Bamse And The Thunder Bell (Swedish:Bamse och Dunderklockan) is a 2018 Swedish animated feature film directed by Johan Kindblom after an original script by Jon Nohrstedt, using Tomas Tivemark's already well-established characters. It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 2018, Toy Story 4. This is the first time since before 2018 where a Bamse production features voice acting by others than only Christian Ryltenius himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well.
