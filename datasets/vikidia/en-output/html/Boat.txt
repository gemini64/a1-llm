Amazon boat
A boat is a sea vehicle capable of moving on water (rivers, lakes, seas and oceans). Larger vessels are considered a ship, while smaller ones are called boats too. Unlike a raft, a ship, like a boat, has a trough shape that gives it the buoyancy, speed, and strength needed to float and move on and across the water.
