Macbeth is a play by William Shakespeare. The date of its composition is uncertain, but 1606 is generally accepted. The play was probably staged shortly after its completion.
The play is set in ancient Scotland. Macbeth is a distinguished general, but his ambitious wife urges him to murder the king. He does so, and becomes king. After this, he must kill and kill again to remain on the throne.
Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's shortest plays. It is possible portions have been lost. Great moments include the "Is this a dagger?" speech and the "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" speech.  Well known scenes include the banquet scene, and the sleepwalking scene.
The play is hugely popular, and has been adapted to an opera by Giuseppe Verdi. Macbeth was made into a movie in the 1940s starring Orson Welles, and the play has been televised many times.
