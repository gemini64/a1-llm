The Sacred War was one of the most famous Soviet songs from World War 2. The music was composed by Alexander Alexandrov, who also composed the Soviet national anthem. The lyrics were written by Vasily Lebedev-Kumach.
The song was composed in a hurry; the lyrics were published the 24th of June, 1941, and Alexsandrov immediately wrote the music for them, writing the notes out on a blackboard for the singers to copy manually. The first performance was on the 26th of June at the Belorussky Rail Terminal, where according to eyewitnesses it was sung five times in succession. Translations have been made in various languages, such as German, Korean, and Hungarian.
The song was often used in Soviet military marches, and is currently used in Russian military marches.
