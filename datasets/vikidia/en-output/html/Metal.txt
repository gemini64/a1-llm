This article is about the group of hard, natural substances known as metal.  For the music genre, see Metal (music genre)
A metal is a type of material. Most metals come from ores, for example, Nickel and Iron.  A few metals occur in the ground (like Gold). Metals take up most of the periodic table. Metalloids have similar properties to metals, but also non-metals. Most metals conduct electricity. Most metals are grey, but some are different colours, for example, copper and gold. Metals also conduct heat way more than other materials.
