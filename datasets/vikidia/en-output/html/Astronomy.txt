Astronomy is the branch of science which pertains to outer space. It is among the oldest science and is a predecessor to physics, though, in more recent space exploration, physics provides formulas for astronomy.  Astronomic development can include stargazing or the launch of satellites or rockets into space.
NASA is a leading company in the current field of astronomy.
