2020 mural of Floyd
George Floyd (Born 14 October 1973 in Houston, Texas; Died 25 May 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) was an African American male, who died while in custody on May 26, 2020. His death was attributed to him being wrongly restrained by a white police officer, whilst he was being arrested. The officer put his knee on Floyd's neck, which restricted his ability to breathe, and subsequently, led to his death. This resulted in a charge of murder against the officer, 44-year-old Derek Chauvin from the Minneapolis Police Department. He was found guilty and was sentenced to 22.5 years in jail.
Three other officers who were present when Floyd was murdered, J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and former officer Thomas Lane, were later found guilty of depriving Floyd of his civil rights, including "were found to have deprived Floyd of his constitutional right to be free from a police officer’s deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs when they saw him restrained in police custody in clear need of medical care and willfully failed to aid him." (*)
Thao and Kueng were also found guilty of depriving Floyd of "his constitutional right to be free from an officer’s unreasonable force when each willfully failed to intervene to stop former MPD Officer Derek Chauvin’s use of unreasonable force." (*) .
All three of these former officers are currently awaiting sentencing, for which no date has been set.
Floyd's death led protests spreading across the world.
