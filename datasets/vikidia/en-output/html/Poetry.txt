Poetry is a special type of writing which tells about ideas, stories, or emotions. Sometimes there is a strong rhythm or beat. Other times there is rhyme or another kind of word pattern.
Poetry usually develops in a culture or a language before regular writing because it usually comes along with music and helps the singer remember the words.
There are many types of poetry styles and patterns new and old. It is often difficult to translate poetry from one language to another, but some of the ideas are so basic that they can be explained even in a different language because human life is so similar around the world.
