A subway is a train that usually goes underground. It's used to travel quickly in the city. Unlike trams and buses, subway trains have no road traffic to slow them down. Also it does not have overhead wires but a metallic pole next to the track that gives electricity to the subway. Many countries call it the "Metro."
