The Capitoline Wolf.
The Capitoline Wolf or Romulus and Remus statue is a famous statue which depicted Romulus and Remus, the two brothers who, according to legend, founded Rome in 753 BC.
It was thought for a long time that it was made by the Etruscans, in the 5th century B.C.. It appeared that it was actually dated from the Middle Ages.
The statue depicts the Roman she-wolf breast-feeding the human twins, which illustrate the legend of the foundation of Rome.
Researchers of the Salento University have studied the famous bronze statue with the help of carbon 14 dating. The results of this technique are that the statue wasn't built on the fifth century B.C., but at the medieval times of the twelfth century. Until then, it was thought that the statue was dated from the fifth century B.C. and had been transported to Rome by the roman armies that were victorious in a campaign against the Etruscans.
It is still possible that it is a copy of an older statue.
It was known that the twins Romulus and Remus had been added at the Renaissance.
The sculpture is made of bronze and is 75 cm high and 114 cm in length. It is exhibited at the Capitol museums in Rome.
