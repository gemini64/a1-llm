The Game is a mind game, of which there is generally accepted to be 3 main rules. Those rules are that either everyone on Earth is always playing The Game, or that everyone who is aware of The Game is always playing it, that thinking about The Game causes one to lose, and that upon losing, one must inform someone else of their loss, causing them to also lose The Game.

Origins
There are multiple theories on who created The Game. Some believe that The Game was created in the 1970s by students of Cambridge University while attempting to create a game that did not fit in with game theory. Others believe that it was created by one Jamie Miller in 1996 to "annoy people". (*) .

Psychology

The Game is an example of ironic process theory, in which attempts to avoid thinking about something will cause one to think about that thing more often. Other examples of this theory include the "White Bear Game", which Leo Tolstoy played with his brother, in which he would stand in a corner and try not to think about a "white bear". Fyodor Dostoevsky also mentioned the white bear game in an essay.  (*)
