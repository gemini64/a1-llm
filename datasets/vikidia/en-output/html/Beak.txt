A goose with an orange-red beak.
A beak is basically a bird's mouth, but it's a little different from our mouths. Instead of lips and teeth, birds have beaks, which are made of hard material like keratin â€“ the same stuff our fingernails are made of.
Now, beaks might seem pretty simple, but they're actually super important for birds. They use their beaks for all sorts of things, like eating, grooming, building nests, and even communicating.
Different birds have different types of beaks, and they're adapted to help them do different things. For example, a bird with a long, pointy beak might use it to catch fish or insects, while a bird with a short, strong beak might use it to crack open nuts or seeds.
Beaks also come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Some are thin and delicate, while others are thick and powerful. And they can be all sorts of colors too, depending on the bird's species and what it eats.
