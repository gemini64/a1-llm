Villa Mercedes is a Villa Mansion built in Lierna Lake Como. The Villa was bought in 2006 by Dieter Zetsche former Global President of Daimler-Benz (Mercedes) and chairman of TUI AG, considered one of the richest men in Germany.
The price for the Villa Mercedes located in the exclusive Borgo di Lierna, with one of the most beautiful views of Bellagio in all of Lake Como, under the paths traveled by Leonardo da Vinci, is estimated at 100 million euros. It is said that Leonardo da Vinci, a guest of Marchesino Stanga in Bellagio, would arrive by boat at the small beach next to this villa to ascend the mountains of Lierna and the Grigne, which he mentions in his notes in the Codex Atlanticus.
