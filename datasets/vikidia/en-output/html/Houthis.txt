The Houthi movement, (Arabic: الحوثيون al-Ḥūthīyūn), officially known as Ansar Allah (أنصار الله ʾAnṣār Allāh, lit. 'Supporters of Allah') is a Shia Islamist political and military organization that emerged from the Saada Governorate of Yemen in the 1990s. It is made up of Zaidi Shias with the name of the movement being drawn largely from the Houthi tribe.
Slogan of the Houthi movement (top-to-bottom):Allah is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, A Curse Upon the Jews, Victory to Islam.
In 2003, the Houthis' official slogan, following in the footsteps of Lebanese Shia political and military organization Hezbollah, became the group's trademark: "God is the Greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Cursed be the Jews, Victory to Islam."
Hussein al-Houthi (The 1st leader of the Houthi Movement) was killed by the Yemeni army in Saada in 2004, along with a number of his personal guards.
His death sparked the Houthi insurgency. Since then, except for a short intervening period, the movement has been led by his brother Abdul-Malik al-Houthi.
