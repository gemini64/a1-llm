The rocket Mercury-Redstone 3
A rocket in astronautics is a vehicle which sends a satellite or some astronauts into space.

Operation
A rocket takes off with a force called action-reaction ; for example, if a cannon shoots a ball which travels 90 kilometers per hour (action), the cannon will move back 4.5 kilometers per hour (reaction). The rocket does the same but vertically.

Structure
Rockets are generally tube-shaped (except the Space Shuttle).
