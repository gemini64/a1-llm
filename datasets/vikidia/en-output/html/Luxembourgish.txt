The area where Luxembourgish is spoken
Luxembourgish or Luxembourgian (Lëtzebuergesch) is a West Germanic language spoken by 390,000 people. Luxembourgish is mostly spoken in Luxembourg, where it is one of the official languages. Luxembourgish is also spoken in surrounding areas in Belgium, France and Germany. In Belgium, Luxembourgish is a minority language. Luxembourgish isn't an official language in the European Union, because nearly all Luxembourgish people are able to speak another official language (mostly German and French).
Luxembourgish is closely related to German, and also influenced by French. Some scholars believe Luxembourgish is a German dialect, while the Luxembourgish people themselves think it's a real language. German is an official language in Luxembourg too.
