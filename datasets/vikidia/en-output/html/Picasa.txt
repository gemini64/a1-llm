Picasa is an image organizer and image viewer for organizing and editing digital images. It is also an integrated photo sharing website originally created in 2002 by a company called Lifescape. In July 2004, Google acquired the rights to Picasa from Lifescape and offered to make it free. "Picasa" is a combination of the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, Mr. Casa (Spanish "My House") and "Pic" (Personalized Art) for Pictures.
