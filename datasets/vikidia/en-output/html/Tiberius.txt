Colossal head of Tiberius
Tiberius (Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus, 16 November 42 BC â€“ 16 March 37) was the second Roman Emperor. He ruled from 14 to 37 AD. He was the step-son of Augustus.
Tiberius was a great general. His campaigns protected the northern frontier.  He reigned for 22 years. The quality of the first half of his reign was excellent, but the latter half was marked with decline.
In 26, Tiberius moved from Rome to the Isle of Capri. He left the administration of the Empire to the unscrupulous Praetorian Prefect Sejanus. Sejanus plotted against Tiberius. Tiberius eventually had him executed.
Caligula, Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, reigned after Tiberius' death.
