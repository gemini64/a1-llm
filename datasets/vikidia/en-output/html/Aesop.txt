Aesop in the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493
Aesop was an Ancient Greek teller of fables and stories. He was born about 620 BC. His date of death is unknown. He was said to have been a hunchbacked slave, and even of African descent. These assertions have not been proven.
Aesop left no writings. His fables were transmitted orally, and collected as Aesop's Fables. A few of the best known are "The Tortoise and the Hare", "The Grasshopper and the Ant", and "The Fox and the Grapes".
