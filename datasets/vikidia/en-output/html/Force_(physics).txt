A force can be described as a push or a pull. Forces make objects change velocity or change direction. Forces can act through contact with objects or at a distance from the object (non-contact). Examples of forces that act through contact with an object include friction, upthrust (buoyancy). Forces that act at a distance include gravity and magnetism.
