Figure skating is a sport. Figure skaters will jump and spin on ice skates. However, elegance and style is another important part of it. Figure skating is often seen as an individual event, but figure skating in mixed pairs (a male and a female skater) is a recognized event. Team figure skating in international competitions is not uncommon.
Before the Winter Olympic Games were started, competitions in figure skating were part of the Summer Olympic Games, in 1908 and 1920.
