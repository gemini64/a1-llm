La boh√®me is a tragic Italian opera in four acts. The words were written by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. The music was written by Giacomo Puccini.
The opera is based on the book, Scenes from the Life of the Bohemians by Henry Murger. "Bohemians" were the poor artists, models, musicians, and poets living in Paris about 1830.

Story

The opera is set in Paris during the winter months of 1830 or so. The story tells of Rudolpho, a poor poet, and his love for Mimi, a poor seamstress. At the same time, the opera follows Marcello, a poor, struggling artist, and his unhappy love for Musetta, a playful young woman who likes money, men, and good times. Rudolpho and Mimi separate after a month or two, but she rejoins him in the last scene to die in his arms of tuberculosis.
