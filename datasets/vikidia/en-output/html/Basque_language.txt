Area where Basque is spoken
Basque (Basque: Euskara) is a language. It is a language isolate, which means it is not related to any other languages. Basque is spoken in parts of northern Spain and extreme southwestern France. There are over 700,000 Basque speakers.
Although Basque is a language isolate, it uses the Latin alphabet and has adopted a large amount of vocabulary from nearby Romance languages, such as Spanish.
