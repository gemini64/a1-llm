After independence in 1971, the national symbol of Bangladesh was adopted.

History
In 1972, the government of Bangladesh entrusted artist Patua Kamrul Hasan with the task of creating the national emblem and various monograms of the newly independent country. Several people, including Mohammad Idris and Shamsul Alam, were given the responsibility of supervising these works. Later, the floating shapla and Shamsul Alam painted by Mohammad Idris were finalized by combining the jute leaves and the four-star part surrounded by rice husks on both sides.

Usage and description
At the center of the national symbol of Bangladesh is a floating water lily which is the national flower of Bangladesh. The water lily is surrounded by two sheaves of rice. At the apex there are three intertwined leaves of jute and two stars on each side of the leaves for a total of four stars. The cosmos and economy of Bangladesh are characterized by water, paddy and jute symbols. The aquatic blossoming water lily placed on these three elements is a symbol of promise, beauty and elegance. The goals and aspirations of the nation have been expressed in the stars

According to the constitution:
The national emblem of the republic is the national flower lily floating in the water, surrounded on both sides by the head of grain, with three interconnected jute leaves at the top, and two stars on each side.
