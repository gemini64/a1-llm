Origin
The Italian sandwich originated in several different Italian-American communities in the northeastern United States from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The popularity of the Italian-American sandwich grew from its origins in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island extending to most of the United States and Canada. With the advent of chain restaurants, it is available in much of the world. Sociologists Edwin Eames and Howard Robboy identified thirteen different terms for the submarine sandwich in the United States.
