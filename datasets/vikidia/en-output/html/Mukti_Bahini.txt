Mukti Bahini (meaning "Liberation Army" in Bengali) was a paramilitary organization formed during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Comprising Bengali military personnel, civilians, and guerilla fighters, the Mukti Bahini played a pivotal role in the struggle for the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan.

Formation:
The Mukti Bahini was officially formed on March 26, 1971, following the declaration of independence by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh. As the Pakistani military cracked down on Bengali nationalists, the Mukti Bahini emerged as a resistance force to counter the oppression.

Objectives:


Independence: The primary objective of the Mukti Bahini was to secure the independence of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) from West Pakistan.
Human Rights: The Mukti Bahini sought to protect the rights and dignity of the Bengali population, which was subjected to widespread human rights abuses by the Pakistani military.



Composition:
The Mukti Bahini consisted of a diverse group of individuals, including defected Bengali military personnel, civilians, and guerilla fighters. The guerilla fighters operated in rural areas, engaging in guerrilla warfare tactics to counter the better-equipped Pakistani military.

Operations:


Guerrilla Warfare: Mukti Bahini employed guerrilla warfare tactics to harass and disrupt Pakistani military operations. They utilized hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and sabotage to wear down the occupying forces.
Coordination with Indian Military: Mukti Bahini coordinated its efforts with the Indian military, which intervened in the conflict on December 3, 1971, leading to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This collaboration proved crucial in the eventual victory for the Bangladeshi independence movement.



Role in Independence:
The Mukti Bahini played a crucial role in the liberation of Bangladesh. By engaging in asymmetric warfare and collaborating with the Indian military, they contributed significantly to the defeat of the Pakistani forces. The conflict culminated in the creation of the sovereign state of Bangladesh on December 16, 1971.
