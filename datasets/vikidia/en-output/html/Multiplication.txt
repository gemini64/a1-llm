Multiplication is a way of calculating. You use the symbol * or x to do a multiplication.Multiplication is a way to make it easier then addition for calculating a lot of times the same number.
The opposite of multiplication is division.
Example : (6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6=60) you can do (10*6=60)
If you want to calculate 5*7(35) the answer would be the same if you calculated 7*5(35).

6*4=24(4+4+4+4+4+4)
3*7=21(7+7+7)
9*9=81(9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9)
