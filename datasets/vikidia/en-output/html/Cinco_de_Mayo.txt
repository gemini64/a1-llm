Cinco de Mayo (Spanish for "Fifth of May") is a celebration held on the May 5. It is celebrated in the United States and in Mexico, primarily in the state of Puebla. There the holiday is called El Día de la Batalla de Puebla (English: The Day of the Battle of Puebla).
The date is observed to commemorate the Mexican army's unlikely victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín.
In the United States, Cinco de Mayo is generally mistaken to be Mexico's Independence Day—the most important national holiday in Mexico—which is celebrated on September 16.
