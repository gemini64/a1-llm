The One Thousand and One Nights is a book of Middle Eastern folk stories. It was written in Arabic more than a thousand years ago and was copied into English in the early 1700s.
Sometimes the book is just called The Arabian Nights.
The stories came from ancient Persia, India, Egypt, Turkey, and other countries.
Many of the stories are still very famous today, like Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.
