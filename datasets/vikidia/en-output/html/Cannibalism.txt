Cannibalism is an act which occurs when a creature of one species, eats another of the same species, sometimes regardless of whether they're alive or not.  We call these creatures “Cannibals”.  Cannibalism is most commonly known among human beings, although it is illegal (against the law) in almost every country on Earth.  There are still some parts of the world where this is a normal practice though, like Papua New Guinea and some areas of Africa and Brazil. Other animals also exhibit this behaviour, such as Chimpanzees, Sharks, and Hippopotamuses, but in these cases, it's usually after the other animal has died.
