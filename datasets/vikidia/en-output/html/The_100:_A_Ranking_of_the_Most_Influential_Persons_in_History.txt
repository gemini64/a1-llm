Michael H. Hart's Top 100 (Original name: The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, Transliteration. The Hundred: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, translation '100: List of the Most Influential Persons in History') Michael H. Published by Hart in 1986 and reprinted in 1992. The book was translated into Bengali and published in 2000. This is a ranking of the 100 people considered Hart, according to Hart, who have influenced human history the most. The book mentions Adolf Hitler at number 39, which indicates that the character traits were not central to the hierarchy of individuals mentioned in the book.

Summary
The first person on Hart's list was the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) of Islam, an election that caused some controversy. Hart claims that Muhammad (pbuh) was the "most successful" person in both religion and secularism. In his own belief, Muhammad's role in the development of Islam was far more influential than Jesus' cooperation in the development of Christianity. He specializes in the development of Christianity by St. Paul, who played a central role in its propagation.
The 1992 reprint included the demotion of personalities related to communism, such as Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, and an introduction by Mikhail Gorbachev. Hart took place in the number of Shakespearean works and replaced William Shakespeare with Edward de Weir, the 18th Earl of Oxford. Hart also replaced Nils Bohr and Antoine Henri Becquerel with Ernest Rutherford. This is how reprinting is done by correcting the errors of the first edition. Henry Ford was also added to the "Honorary Mention" list, replacing Pablo Picasso. Finally, although different individuals were re-listed, none of the top ten listed individuals were relocated.
