Male pronghorn
A pronghorn is a large mammal of western North America like an antelope or deer.
Both the female and male animals have horns which branch in two curved parts. They shed, or lose, the outer part of their horns at certain times of the year.
There were many millions of them, but they were hunted by settlers until very few were left. Now there are about half a million pronghorns and they are not in danger of being extinct anymore.
They can run fast and leap far. They live in groups in dry grasslands and deserts and eat plants.
