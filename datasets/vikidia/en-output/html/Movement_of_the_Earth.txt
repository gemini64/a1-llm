The movement of the Earth is how the Earth moves. There are two movements;

Rotation - the movement of the Earth on this Axis
Revolution - the movement of the Earth around the sun.


Axis
The axis is an imaginary line running through the center of the Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole. The Earth is tilted at an angle and rotates around the axis.

The solar year
The period of time required of the Earth to make a complete revolution around the Sun measured from one vernal equinox, to the next, is equal to 365 days and 6 hours.
Also called astronomic gear ar tropical gear.
