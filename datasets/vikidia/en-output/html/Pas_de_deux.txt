A pas de deux is a French term meaning "dance for two". The term is used in ballet. It is a dance for a male dancer and a ballerina. Well known examples are The Black Swan pas de deux in Swan Lake, the Bluebird pas de deux in The Sleeping Beauty, and the Grand pas de deux for the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier in The Nutcracker.
A pas de deux has three or four short separate dances. The first dance is an elegant, slow dance for both dancers. The next dance is a solo for the male dancer. This is followed by a short dance for the ballerina like the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" in The Nutcracker. The fourth and last dance is a quick one for both dancers.
