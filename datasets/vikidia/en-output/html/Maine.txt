Maine is a state in the northeastern United States, in the New England region. In 2015, it had 1,329,328 people. (*)
Augusta is the state capital, and Portland is the largest city.
Maine is bordered by the Canadian provinces Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the northeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and New Hampshire to the southwest.

Geography
Its coast is famously jagged, and if stretched straight would be over 2,000 miles.  It is full of little islands, bays, and insets.  It is often unsafe for ships to hit the coast of Maine, which is why it has so many lighthouses.  The forests of Maine are very dense and crowded with trees, plants, and bugs.
