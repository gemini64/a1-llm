The Imperial State Crown of the United Kingdom.
A crown is a kind of headgear, which a monarch wears. The crown symbolizes the power, legitimacy, victory, triumph and glory of the nation. In the past, a crown made clear who the monarch was. Today, in most monarchies crowns became part of a tradition. Nowadays, a monarch doesn't wear a crown all day, but only on special occasions.
The crown is worn by a monarch on the coronation for the first time. A high ranked person, like a bishop, crowns this person to a monarch by laying the crown on his head. Most monarchies have various crowns, which are used on different occasions, like the coronation crown and state crown. Most crowns are made from precious materials, like gold and silver with jewels. The form of the crown varies by nation. Some monarchs made each their own crown.
