The Uni√£o da Juventude Monarquista (UJM) is a Brazilian organization founded on May 18, 2024. The UJM defends the restoration of the monarchy in Brazil and other countries in the world, promoting a hybrid ideology that combines elements of left and right. The main goal is the implementation of a hereditary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, where the head of state, entitled Emperor or Empress, is elected through dynastic succession, passing from mother to son or daughter. The 'Monarchist Youth Union' emerged in a context of growing dissatisfaction with the republican system and recurring political crises in Brazil. Founded by a group of young activists and intellectuals, the UJM proposes a model of governance that seeks to combine the stability and tradition of the monarchy with modern democratic principles.
