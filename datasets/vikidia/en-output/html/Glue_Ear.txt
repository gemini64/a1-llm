Glue ear is a medical condition where the inside of the ear fills with liquid, causing loss of hearing. It earned its name because sometimes this liquid can be thick and sticky, like glue. It is common in toddlers but can occur in older people too. It usually cures on its own, but antibiotics may be needed in severe cases.
