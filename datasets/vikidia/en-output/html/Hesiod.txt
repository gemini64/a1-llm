“Pseudo-Seneca”: the bust was identified for a very long time with the Roman philosopher Seneca. It was acknowledged as spurious. It may actually represent Hesiod. Roman copy after a lost Hellenistic original
Hesiod was an Ancient Greek poet. He may have been active about 750 and 650 BC, the same time as Homer. Three works attributed to Hesiod by ancient commentators have survived: Works and Days, Theogony and Shield of Heracles. Modern scholars have doubts about Shield of Heracles.
