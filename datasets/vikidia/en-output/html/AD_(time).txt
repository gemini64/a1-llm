AD is a short way of giving the year in the West.
For example "2000 AD" means two thousand years since Jesus Christ was born. It stands for the Latin words Anno Domini which means "year of our Lord".
Sometimes you will see "2000 CE" which means "Christian Era" instead of AD.
The term "BC" means "Before Christ" and is sometimes written "BCE" or "Before Christian Era".
Anno Domini was used in writing in the West sometime in the first century.
