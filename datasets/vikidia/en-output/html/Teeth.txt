Teeth are hard body parts located in the jaw, often attached to the gums. Teeth are used to chew and break down food. Humans typically have two sets of teeth, deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth or milk teeth, and permanent adult teeth. The number of teeth in a mouth varies from creature to creature. Humans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, "baby" or "milk") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. The types of teeth are incisors, canines, premolars (also called bicuspids), and molars. Incisors are mostly used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars are for grinding.
