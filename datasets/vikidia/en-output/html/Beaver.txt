The Beaver is an animal that make dams. There are two species of beavers, which are found in the forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. These animals are active all winter, swimming and foraging in their ponds even when a layer of ice covers the surface. Beavers are second only to humans in their ability to manipulate and change their environment.
