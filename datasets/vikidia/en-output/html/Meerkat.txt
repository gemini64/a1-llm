The meerkat (scientific name : Suricata suricatta) is a small african mammal. It is also sometimes called suricate and belongs to the mongoose family.

Description
Like other mongooses, meerkats have slender bodies, large heads, small ears and long tails. They have long, curved claws that enable them to dig and unearth plants. They measure between 24 and 35 cm (excluding their tail) and weigh no more than 1 kg.
Meerkats are famous for their ability to stand on their hind legs. They use their tails to balance themselves.
The coat is beige or light grey, with dark stripes on the back. They have black patches around their eyes which help them to be less dazzled by the sun.

Behaviour
A mob of meerkats in South Africa.
Meerkats are very social animals. They form colonies of up to thirty members and live together in large burrows. A group of meerkats is called a mob.
Meerkat colonies are very aggressive and attack each other when they cross paths, often causing very serious injuries.

Diet
The meerkat is mainly carnivorous. Its diet consists of small animals such as rodents, birds, lizardsâ€¦ It can hunt scorpions and snakes because it is immune to most venoms. It also eats a lot of insects, particularly beetles.
Meerkats eat plants and fruit too because it helps them stay hydrated.

Distribution
Meerkats live in southern Africa, in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and a very small part of Angola.
They are found in arid areas such as savannas and plains.

In culture
Meerkats feature heavily in the media, both on TV and in books.
In the animated films The Lion King, Timon, the best friend of the warthog Pumbaa, is a meerkat.
