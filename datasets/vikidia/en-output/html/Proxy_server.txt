A Proxy server in a computer network is a server (a computer system or application) that acts as a mediator in requests for information from other clients from the client.
The client communicates with the proxy server at the request of a service (a file, or a connection, or a web page, or any other) under a different server. The proxy server simplifies the request by considering its complexity. Proxies were invented to streamline the distributed system and add encapsulation to it. Most proxies today are web-proxies, which make it easy to access information on the World Wide Web while maintaining user neutrality.
