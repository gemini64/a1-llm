The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a conflict between India and Pakistan that took place from April 1965 to September 1965. The war was primarily fought over the Kashmir region, a longstanding point of contention between the two neighboring countries. The conflict marked the second major military engagement between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947.

Background:
The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, with a Muslim majority population but a Hindu ruler, became a focal point of tension. The 1965 war was preceded by various skirmishes and border clashes in the region.

Causes:
Several factors contributed to the outbreak of the war. The territorial dispute over Kashmir, infiltration by militants into the region, and water-sharing issues related to the Indus River were among the main causes. Additionally, political and economic grievances between the two nations added to the overall tension.

Course of the War:
The conflict began with skirmishes along the international border and the Line of Control in Kashmir. Pakistan launched a military operation named "Operation Gibraltar," which aimed at supporting Kashmiri insurgents. India responded with a full-scale military intervention, and the war escalated into a broader conflict.
The war saw significant battles on both the western and eastern fronts. In the west, the Pakistani army made advances in the Chhamb sector, but India successfully defended key areas. In the east, India launched a successful campaign in the Punjab region and threatened the Pakistani city of Lahore.

Tashkent Agreement:
International pressure, particularly from the United States and the Soviet Union, led to a ceasefire in September 1965. Both nations agreed to a peace process brokered by the Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The Tashkent Agreement, signed on January 10, 1966, facilitated the withdrawal of forces to pre-war positions and addressed various issues, including the release of prisoners of war.

Aftermath:
The war did not result in significant changes to the territorial boundaries between India and Pakistan. The Line of Control in Kashmir, largely unchanged since the 1949 ceasefire, continued to serve as the de facto border. The conflict had a lasting impact on the diplomatic relations between the two countries, and tensions in the region persisted in the subsequent decades.
The 1965 Indo-Pakistani War remains a crucial chapter in the history of South Asia, influencing the geopolitics of the region and shaping the ongoing disputes between India and Pakistan.
