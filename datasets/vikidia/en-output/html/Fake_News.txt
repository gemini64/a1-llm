Fake News is news that isn't true (that is Fake). Fake News can have small effects but it can also have very big ones. People could use Fake News because they want a specific president. Fake News can spread quite fast if we don't know what we are reading.

Different ways of making Fake News

There is a program to make faces or change them,so someone could replace a picture with a false one.
There's also a program to make the voice of someone say something that he didn't say. So someone could make a important person say something very embarrassing, that could cause a few or even a lot of problems for that important person.

Also if there are a lot of exclamation marks.
