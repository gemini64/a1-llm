Social entrepreneurship is the design and running of an enterprise whose aim is to positively change society by addressing social, environmental or cultural issues.
The enterprise may be conducted fully as a non-profit organisation. It may also be run as a for-profit business whose benefits are fully reinvested into activities pursuing the same overall goal (either in the same enterprise or in partner non-profit organisation).
