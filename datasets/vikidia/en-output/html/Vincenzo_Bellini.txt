Plaque in Catania, Sicily, marking Bellini's birthplace
Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini was an Italian composer of bel canto operas. He was born on 3 November 1801 in Catania, Sicily, and died on 23 September 1835 in Puteaux, France. He never married and had no children; he may have been gay.
Bellini wrote less than a dozen operas, but these operas are superb. His works include Il pirata (1827), I Capuleti ed i Montecchi (1830), La sonnambula (1831), Norma (1831), Beatrice di Tenda (1833), and I puritani (1835).
