BASE Jumping from the Sapphire Tower in Istanbul.BASE jumping is an extreme sport, such as jumping from a cliff and using a parachute to slow down before the ground is reached. It is called an extreme sport because it can be very dangerous. Some BASE jumpers die because they do not have enough time to open their parachute. A BASE jump from 150m (500Â feet) will have a parachute ride of only 10 to 15 seconds.
Each of the letters in "BASE" are an abbreviation for the four locations people use to jump from with parachutes: buildings, antennas (for TV stations or cell phone towers), spans (bridges) and the earth (cliffs, mountains). (*)

In the news
In September 2013, three men jumped from the One World Trade Center in New York City. The building was still under construction then. They made a video of their jump using cameras on their heads. They then put it on YouTube.  The jumpers and a helper on the ground were later arrested, after turning themselves in to police. (*)
