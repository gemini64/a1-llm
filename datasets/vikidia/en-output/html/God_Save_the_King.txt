John Bull is credited with composing the melody for "God Save the King"
God Save the King (or the Queen) is the national anthem of the United Kingdom. It is played at the conclusion of all important public ceremonies, at the end of concerts, plays and at the beginning of athletic meetings.
It dates from 1740. It is attributed to Henry Carey, inspired by a melody of John Bull dating from 1619. In the United States, the British anthem's melody is used for the patriotic "My Country, 'Tis of Thee".
