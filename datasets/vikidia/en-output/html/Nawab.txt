Nawab or Nawab (Persian-Arabic: Nawab, Devanagari: Nawab) is an honorary title of the Muslim rulers of South Asia. During the Mughal Empire, this title was given to various jagirdars. Begum is usually used as the noun of the Nawab.

History
It is a Hindustani word, used in Urdu, Bengali and Hindi, and several North Indian languages. The word is derived from a Persian word collected from Arabic. Originally the word originated from "naib". In some areas, especially in Bengal, the word is pronounced as Nawab. The word Nawab later entered English and other foreign languages.
