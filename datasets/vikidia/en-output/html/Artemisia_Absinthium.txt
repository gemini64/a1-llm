Artemisia absinthium, also known as absinthe, is a plant related to daisies, from which the alcoholic beverage absinthe is produced. The name Artemisia comes from a Greek name given to Diana, Goddess of the moon. In ancient times the Greeks dedicated this plant to Artemis, goddess of fertility, because wormwood was used to treat menstrual disorders.
