A soft drink is a type of drink that is made from the special formula, water, sugar and carbonation made by gas. A "diet" soft drink has artificial sweeteners instead of sugar.
Soft drinks are unhealthy because they contain a lot of sugar and acid. A person who fills up on soft drinks may skip other, more nutritious food and drinks.
