Jedi Bob Lego minifigure
The Jedi only known to The Galaxy by the name Jedi Bob was the most legendary Jedi Master in the entire history of the Jedi Order. His real name was unknown, as all who would possess that knowledge immediately dropped dead upon hearing it. Bob appeared as an unnamed Jedi Knight LEGO minifigure in the first LEGO Star Wars Republic Gunship set, which was released in 2002. And in 2024 after a 22 yer wait Jedi Bob made his TV deputy in Lego Star wars: Rebuild the Galaxy.
