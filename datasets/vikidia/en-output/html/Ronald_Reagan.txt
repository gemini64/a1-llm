Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis
Ronald  Wilson Reagan (6 Febuary 1911 - 11 June 2004)  was the 40th president of the United States. He was president from 20 January 1981 –20 January 1989. He was born on 6 February 1911 and died on 5 June 2004 (aged 93). He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, though it is suspected he may have begun showing symptoms of it during the late 80s, and he died in 2004, possibly of old age, or because of the Alzheimer's, since it causes the brain to slowly die. He is widely known as the oldest elected president in U.S history before Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
