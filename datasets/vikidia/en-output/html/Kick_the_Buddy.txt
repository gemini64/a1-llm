Kick the Buddy is an app that allows players to beat a ragdoll figure to oblivion. Touted as a stress-relieving game, Kick the Buddy is a puppet-like figure that players, with their choice of weapon, inflict abuse upon until knocking out, exploding, or killing. The makers of the game say "it's a way to relieve stress". Players use weapons on a puppet-like figure until the cartoon faints, explodes or dies. The PEGI age restriction for Kick the Buddy is 12. (*)  However, Kick The Buddy ended in April 2012 so it would be replaced and get a sequel known as Kick the Buddy: Second Kick.

History
This game started at 2011, but it wasn't so popular. Gold didn't exist, there were not many weapons, etc. On April 2012, so it may become more popular, it was removed, and later, it was remade as Second Kick. The game is currently being developed by Chill Fleet. In the loading screen for the current version, it is developed by Playgendary.

Glitches
Kick The Buddy's glitch. (*)
Kick The Buddy's another glitch.

Buddy's Face

When feeding Buddy to the Shark and refreshing the box whilst the shark eats him, buddy's mouth stays wide open even after he says some of his quotes.
When Buddy is killed, sometimes he is seen smiling whilst he is dead
sometimes this happens when his mouth is wide open
When you turn Buddy into stone using Gorgon and selecting the oven and placing him in the cake, buddy still cries although he is frozen
After Buddy has been smashed into the wall, he respawns at the bottom of the oven
When using the Trumpet or Gas Nozzle on Buddy and place them on him and start kicking his face multiple times, his mouth will be shut when he is using those items.



The Present

When selecting the aliens, throwing a baby alien onto buddy's face and leaving the present on the screen, once the big alien has eaten buddy, the present pops up over the present you left on.
When feeding buddy the Hot-dog or Trick or Treat and exploding him, the present will pop up, if you skip the present and select a different weapon/item, buddy will be refreshed back to normal (but still dead), but the present pops up again.
If buddy is about to be killed and the player clicks on the free gold button(when it is free to click), the gold reward pops up, but the present still pops up, overlapping the reward.
Some rare times are when the gold reward overlaps the present.
When buddy is being killed and you pull the notebook down as fast as you can right before buddy dies, the present either overlaps the notebook or the notebook disappears.
Some rare times are when:
The Notebook disappears, but the "Diamond Membership/Premium", "Add Blood" and "Remove Ads" buttons still remains.
The content in the notebook disappear from inside the notebook unless you click the back button and re-open the notebook.



The Fridgerator

If a explosion happens inside a closed and broken fridgerator, with some cola bottles and buddy inside and shake it, once it explodes, inside the Fridgerator doors, some developer textures will appear, like some buddy sprites and possibly text.



Buddy Bucks

If the user fills up buddy with the Gas Nozzle and shoots him with the pencil gun, the money will instantly rise up at approximately 500 b.p.s (bucks per second).
It's best to use 3 Pencil Guns to do the glitch.



The Drip Bags

When mixing blue and green together once vaccinating the buddy, buddy will still vomit when he is frozen.



"Rate it"

When buddy just dies and you enter the bank, notebook or other things (except for the lucky slots), the "Rate it" screen will pop up over it



Buddy's Limbs

When putting Buddy in the Paper Shredder, all of his limbs disappear



Buddy's Body

Sometimes when buddy becomes "Super-sized Buddy" and feeding him a peace of kicks fruit, his tummy will become tiny.
Rarely, Buddy's Body parts can disappear. however, his limbs are still intact so the player can see where he is.
Recently, A user by the name of "Dom playz" found a glitch where Buddy's head can get stuck out of the box.
Buddy will freeze at approx 1 min later and the game will exit by itself.



Buddy Respawning in an Awkward Place

If you had already put buddy in the Shredding Machine and refreshed the box, and the player places the machine back with buddy all broken apart, buddy will respawn inside the machine instead of the side where he would come out



The Game itself

Sometimes when loading up the game, the loading screen becomes intact when the game has already started.
