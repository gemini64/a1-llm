For other uses, see Mummy (disambiguation)

A mummy is a dead human or animal whose soft tissues and organs have been preserved through accidental or intentional exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, or lack of air, so that it does not decay further.
The process of creating a mummy is called "mummification". This was a common way of preserving the dead in Ancient Egypt.
