History


In 1955-1956, the first meeting of the Champions League was held, which included, upon invitation, sixteen teams from the main European football federations. Real Madrid in a few years had become the strongest team in the Champions League because of winning the cup for 5 years straight. The first Italian team that won the Champions was Milan, who won the Cup in 1963. The Italian teams who won the Champions later are Inter and Juventus. At the beginning, the tournament included two rounds of direct elimination, but in 1991 other elimination stages were introduced, making the race more competitive. In 1992 the competition changed its name to the current UEFA Champions League. Until 1997 only the winning teams of the respective national championships participated. Since 1997, it was decided that even the teams that had reached the second, the third and the fourth places could participate.
