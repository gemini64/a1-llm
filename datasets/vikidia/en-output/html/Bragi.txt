Bragi is a god from Norse mythology associated with poetry, eloquence, and wisdom, and is often regarded as the god of skalds (Norse poets). His name is derived from the Old Norse word bragr, meaning "poetry" or "the art of poetic speech." In the sagas and myths, Bragi is depicted as a figure who embodies the ideals of eloquence and verbal skill, making him an important deity in a culture that valued storytelling, poetry, and verbal art.
Key Characteristics of Bragi:
God of Poetry and Eloquence: Bragi is primarily known for his mastery of poetry, and skalds would invoke him when seeking inspiration for their verses. He was believed to have a deep understanding of words, language, and song.
Wisdom and Knowledge: Like other gods of wisdom in Norse mythology (such as Odin), Bragi is revered for his knowledge, especially in relation to the spoken word. His wisdom is reflected in his role as a speaker and entertainer in the halls of the gods.
Connection to Odin: In some accounts, Bragi is said to be the son of Odin, although this detail varies between sources. Odin himself is often associated with poetry, especially after he drank from the mead of poetry, which gave him unparalleled skill in verse. This shared connection to poetry strengthens Bragi’s ties to the Allfather.
Appearance: Bragi is described as having a long, flowing beard—in fact, his beard became so iconic that "Bragi's beard" was used as a metaphor for wisdom and maturity in skaldic poetry.
Wife – Idunn: Bragi is married to Idunn, the goddess who guards the golden apples of youth that keep the gods eternally young. This connection to Idunn aligns Bragi with themes of renewal and vitality, as poetry was seen as a life-giving and culture-preserving force.
Role in Valhalla: In some stories, Bragi is depicted as the official bard of Valhalla, the great hall of the slain warriors. He entertains the warriors with his poetry and songs, celebrating their bravery and deeds.
Mythological Appearances:
Bragi is not a major character in Norse mythology, but he appears in the Prose Edda, where he is mentioned as one of the Æsir.
In the Poetic Edda, Bragi is featured in a dialogue with the hero Loki in the poem Lokasenna, where Loki insults the gods during a feast. Bragi tries to maintain the peace by offering Loki gifts, but the exchange leads to Loki insulting him, calling him cowardly for not being as brave as the other gods.
Historical Bragi:
It’s worth noting that some scholars believe Bragi may have originally been a deified version of a historical skald, Bragi Boddason, who was a famous 9th-century poet at the court of several Norse kings. His poetry is among the earliest known examples of Old Norse verse, and some later traditions might have conflated the man with the divine figure of Bragi.
