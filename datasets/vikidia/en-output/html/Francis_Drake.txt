Miniature portrait of Sir Francis Drake in 1581.
Sir Francis Drake (circa 1540-1596) was an English corsair, explorer, and slave trader.

Beginnings

Drake was born into a large and poor Protestant family in Devon, in the southwest of England. At the age of 12 or 13, he went on board of a merchant ship which he took charge of when he was 20 years old.
In 1567 he left for an expedition to Africa with his uncle John Hawkins, with aim to buy slaves there and sell them in new American colonies. In a bay in the Caribbean, they were encircled by the Spaniards, from whom they narrowly escaped.
In the following years, Drake and his men plundered the Spanish colonies in America. This sailor became a fearless warrior. In 1572, at the head of two ships, he took from the Spanish the Nombre-de-Dios and Venta de Cruz locations, located on the east coast of the Isthmus of Panama.
In 1570, Queen Elizabeth gave him a letter of marque (which authorize him to continue robbing foreign ships without any possible future punishment from government).

Around the world

Francis Drake is the first Englishman to make a voyage around the world.

Crossing the Atlantic

With five ships and 164 men, the fleet of Drake embarked Plymouth on December 13 of 1577. Just after departure, they come across a Spanish ship. On January 30, 1578, at Cape Verde Islands, the Englishmen capture two Portuguese ships along with their captain Nuno da Silva, the man having a great deal of experience in voyages and navigation While crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the fleet was caught in violent storm. On June 18, 1578, the fleet, having lost two ships, arrived to San Julian, in Patagonia. Drake decide to spend the winter (Mayâ€“August 1578) in the bay. On August 20, 1578, the three surviving ships approached the Strait of Magellan, which they crossed in 16 days. He discovered South of the Tierra del Fuego, the passage by the Cape Horn.

The Pacific
Out of the strait, the fleet was caught by storm again. On July 23, the Golden Hind left the new colony and crossed the Pacific Ocean. He then went up north along the entire coast of North America, hoping to find a northwest passage to the Atlantic. Not having found a passage, he came to California and took the territory under the control of the British Crown.
