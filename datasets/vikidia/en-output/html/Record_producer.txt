A record producer or music producer is a person who takes charge of a recording session, in the same way that a film director is in charge of shooting films. Record producers help musicians and recording artists create singles and albums. The producer controls recording sessions, coaches and guides musicians, and oversees the recording, mixing, and mastering processes to finalize the music.
