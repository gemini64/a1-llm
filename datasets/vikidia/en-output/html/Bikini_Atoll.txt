thumb|nuclear explosion on Atollon Bikini (colored image)
Bikini Atoll is an atoll located in the Pacific Ocean, in the Marshall Islands archipelago in Oceania. It is famous because the United States government conducted nuclear weapon tests there between 1946 and 1958.
Bikini Atoll is part of the Marshall Islands.
The atoll gave its name to the bikini, a two-piece swimsuit. His inventor, Louis RÃ©ard, called it that way because he jokingly said that this garment would cause the same impact as a nuclear explosion on society, since previous swimsuits covered much more the body.
