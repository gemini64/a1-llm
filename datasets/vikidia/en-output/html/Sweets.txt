Sweets (British English; Candy in US English and Lollies in Australia and New Zealand) are a snack food whose main ingredient is sugar or sugar substitutes. It is usually made in small pieces for individual servings.
Some sweets are popular globally, others are specific to local cuisines. Popular sweets are made, packaged and sold commercially for a uniform product, rather than homemade.
There are traditions for sweets eaten at certain festivals and holidays, such as Halloween.
