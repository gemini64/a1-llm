History
In ancient times, several German tribes inhabited much of the land of modern Germany.  During the Roman Empire's expansion under Julius Caesar and others that followed him, much of the western and southern part of current day Germany was occupied by the Romans and became part of the Roman Empire. Later people from the northern part of current day Germany invaded the Roman Empire. This was a cause in the downfall of the Roman Empire, and the
subsequent Dark Ages of Europe.
The National Flag of Germany.
By the beginning of the medieval times time Germany consisted of a number of small tribal states.
In the beginning of the 8th century an attempt was made by Charlemagne (a name derived from Latin, meaning "Charles the Great"), a king of a great German tribe called the Franks, to unite them.
After Charlemagne's death in 814, following German customs of those times, his land was divided up to his three sons. Modern day Germany became a  part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, that contained much of central Europe (with the exception of France).
Although events reduced the size of this Empire, it destruction only came in 1806/07 after being overrun by Napoleon Bonaparte's forces from France.
After Napoleon's defeat, in the next decades Germany was first united in a loose German Custom Union, (a loose connection of states that maintained some autonomy, or self-rule). Prussia, one of the largest of these states managed to unify the majority of the German states in the Northern German Confederation, a far stronger union, as well as limiting foreign influence on other German states from outside powers.
In 1871, the entirety of Germany was finally unified in a land that stretched from the boarders of modern-day France to the boarders of modern-day Russia. This was one of the "Central Powers" of World War I that started and eventually lost the war. Germany, being a loser in this war, was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, thus giving much of its land away to France, Poland and Russia. The treaty also limited Germany's influence on world affairs significantly, and fines placed on them by the allied brought their economy to near ruin.

German dissatisfaction with the treaty, and economic crisis made it easy for Adolf Hitler to promote his extreme form of Nationalism, leading to his rise in 1933.
Initially, perusing the goal of 'unification' of the German peoples, Hitler first made alliances with
Austria. In 1938, he occupied the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia, and despite an agreement with other powers such as Britain later occupied the whole of that country. In 1939 the German invasion of Poland, began World War II in Europe.
After World War II, Germany was a ruin, and despite initial hopes at the Potsdam conference,
quickly became divided by the opposing ideals of America (and the Allied powers) and Soviet Union.
For at least four decades, Germany was divided. Those in East living under an increasingly
strained Communist regime (see the page about the DDR, East Germany). Those in the West assisted by American aid, had their economy recovering quickly and where amongst the founder members of the European Union. The Berlin Wall was built in the 1960s dividing Communist East Berlin from Capitalist West Berlin.
German re-unification came in 1990 as a consequence of dissatisfaction in the east with the
increasingly brutal regime. In 1989 the Berlin Wall, which had since divided
the former capital Berlin, had fallen (opened) and was finally dismantled.

Primary education usually lasts for four years. In contrast, secondary education includes four types of schools based on a pupil's ability as determined by teacher recommendations: the Gymnasium includes the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies and attendance lasts eight or nine years depending on the state; the Realschule has a broader range of emphasis for average students and lasts six years; the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education, and the Gesamtschule or comprehensive school combines the three approaches.
