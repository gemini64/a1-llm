The soul is the supposed spirit of a person, which go to the heaven when this person dies. It is an important belief in religion.
In literature, the Devil often makes attempts to trade something of value for a person's soul.  This occurs in The Devil and Daniel Webster, and Bedazzled.  The soul is also seen in several episodes of Tom and Jerry.
