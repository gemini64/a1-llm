History

The New York Times is a US newspaper that started in 1851. It was originally called the New-York Daily Times. Over the years, it became well-known for reporting important news and stories from around the world. (*)

1870-1990
In the 1870s, the newspaper gained national attention by exposing the corruption of a politician named William M. Tweed. Later, in 1896, a man named Adolph Ochs took control of the newspaper and helped it grow even more.
One of the most famous moments in its history was in 1971 when The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers. These were secret documents about the Vietnam War, and their publication was a big deal because it showed the importance of freedom of the press.
In the 1980s and 1990s, The New York Times started using computers and the internet to share news. Today, it has millions of readers both in print and online, and it continues to be one of the most respected newspapers in the world. (*)

Company
The New York Times is owned by The New York Times Company, which has been controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family since 1896. The current chairman and publisher is A. G. Sulzberger. The family owns about a fifth of the company and maintains control through a special class of voting shares. (*)
