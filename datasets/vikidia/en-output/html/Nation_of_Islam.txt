The Nation of Islam (NOI) is an African-American ethnoreligious Black nationalist organization. It was founded on 4 July 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad.
The Nation of Islam teaches that there has been a succession of mortal gods each a black man called Allah and Wallace Fard Muhammad is the most recent. The first Allah created the Arabic-speaking, dark-skinned Tribe of Shabazz, from whom all people of color are descended. It believes that a scientist called Yakub created the White race. The whites lacked inner divinity and were intrinsically violent and they overthrew the Tribe of Shabazz and achieved global dominance.
The Anti Defamation League has characterized the Nation of Islam as a black supremacist hate group that promotes racism against white people, antisemitism, and homophobia.
