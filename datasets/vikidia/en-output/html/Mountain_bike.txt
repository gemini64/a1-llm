A full-suspension mountain bike
A mountain bike or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes are like other bikes, but have different features. These include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels. They also have more powerful brakes and lower gear ratios needed for steep hills. Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, fire roads, logging roads, and other places where there are no roads.
