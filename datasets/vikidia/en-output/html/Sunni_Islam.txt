Sunni Islam is one of the two major branches of Islam. It is the most widely followed sect within the Islamic faith and has significant adherence worldwide. Sunni Islam emphasizes the traditions and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, which are recorded in the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet). The followers of Sunni Islam place great importance on adherence to the Sunnah, which are the practices of Muhammad.

History
Sunni Islam emerged after the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, during the early years of the Islamic community. The term "Sunni" comes from "Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah," which means "People of the Sunnah and the Community." Initially, the Muslim community divided into two groups over the issue of succession: those who supported Abu Bakr, the Prophet's close companion, became known as Sunnis, while the supporters of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, formed the Shia sect. The Sunnis became the majority sect within Islam, and various schools of jurisprudence developed over time, each with its interpretations of Islamic law. These schools, such as the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali, differ in legal methodology and interpretation, but they all share fundamental beliefs in the Quran and the Sunnah.
