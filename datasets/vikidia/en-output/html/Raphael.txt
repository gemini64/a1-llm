Raphael's Self-Portrait, 1506
Raphael (born Raffaello Sanzio) was an Italian painter and architect of the Italian Renaissance. With his compatriots Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael is considered one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance.

Life

Raphael was born on 6 April 1483 at Urbino, Marche, Italy. He died on 6 April 1520 (aged 37) at Rome, Italy.
His father was court painter to the Duke of Urbino. From his earliest years, Raphael moved among the dignitaries of the court and church. In these circles, he learned the social graces and the tact necessary to succeed as an artist.

Perugia
Raphael was about 15 when he joined the workshop of Pietro Perugino, one of the famous artists of the period. Raphael learned much about painting from Perugino.
Raphael's first major work was The Marriage of the Virgin (1504). It was influenced by Perugino's painting for the Sistine Chapel of Jesus giving the Keys to Saint Peter.

Florence
In 1504, Raphael moved to Florence, Italy. He studied the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.
It was in Florence that Raphael painted most of his Madonnas. The Madonna and Child was a popular theme in Florence at the time.

Rome
In 1508, Pope Julius II invited Raphael to Rome to paint several rooms in the Vatican. Works painted for these rooms include The School of Athens, The Disputation of the Sacrament, and Parnassus. Raphael remained in Rome for the rest of his life, dying at age 37 in 1520.
