A vegetable is a type of food group that comes from plants. A vegetable may be a root, stem, or leaf, while the seed is the plant's fruit. Vegetables are savory rather than sweet because they lack the sugar of fruit. They are typically rich in minerals and vitamins. They may be eaten raw or cooked. Some root vegetables can be stored a long time.
