Haydn in 1791
The Symphony No. 94 in G major was composed by Franz Joseph Haydn in 1791 for a series of concerts he was giving in London. The symphony is nicknamed the "Surprise" Symphony because a loud chord interrupts the serenity of the second movement. It is also known as the Symphony "with the drum beat".
Haydn conducted the first performance of the symphony at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 23 March 1792. A typical performance of the symphony lasts about 23 minutes.
The symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:

I. Adagio â€“ Vivace assai
II. Andante
III. Menuetto: Allegro molto
IV. Finale: Allegro molto
