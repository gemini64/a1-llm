Liquid is a state of matter in which particles are more capable of movement than in a solid, thus the shape of a body of liquid is not fixed, but not as in a gas, thus the volume is.  Any substance is in the liquid phase when its temperature is between its freezing/melting point and its boiling/condensing point.
