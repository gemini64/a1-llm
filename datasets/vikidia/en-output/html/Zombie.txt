thumb|Zombies
A zombie is a fictional creature. It is a dead human being brought back to life in the form of a walking corpse and normally with a taste for eating human flesh (especially the brains of the living). The word zombie comes from the island of Haiti, since their inhabitants believed that there were sorcerers who could take away people's will and make them their slaves. In modern stories it is more common for zombies to appear due to some type of virus and not for some magical reason. They are usually dressed in tattered clothes, covered in blood and with decomposing skin. In addition, they prefer to attack in a group.
