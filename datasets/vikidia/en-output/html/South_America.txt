Map of South America
South America is a continent. It is located entirely in the Western Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. South America has thirteen countries and three territories, including two island territories.
It is bound by the Caribbean Sea and North America to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.  The Andes Mountains run close to the west coast, and the center and northeast is dominated by the basin of the Amazon River and the Amazon Rainforest.  South of that is the Brazilian Highlands and the prairies of Patagonia, and south of that, the highest Andes Mountains and the frigid Tierra del Sur.
