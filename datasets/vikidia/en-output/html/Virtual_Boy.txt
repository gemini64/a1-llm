The Virtual Boy was one of Nintendo's biggest commercial failures as the 1st VR home-console headset. It was released in 1995, but it got discontinued a year later.
This was supposed to be the 1st VR headset with plenty of games using a set of red and black LCD lights, however, it was hardly critiziced for it's poor performance, also adding headaches and dizzyness after using it for a good period of time. The colors are bright and that caused headaches to unexperienced VR players
