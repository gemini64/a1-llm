The back side of the moon is covered with craters
Fleming is a large lunar crater on the Moon's far side. It was named after the astronomer Williamina Fleming (1857â€“1911). (*)
Fleming cannot be seen from the Earth. It lies about a crater diameter to the east-northeast of Hertz. It is northwest of Lobachevskiy. The low rim of this crater is heavily eroded. The floor of the crater is also marked by a number of small impacts.
