The movie was based on the Mary Poppins children's books by P. L. Travers. In the books, Poppins is a strict and pompous character, but in the movie she is transformed into a gentle and kindly character. The movie setting was changed from the 1930s of the books to the Edwardian era.
Travers objected to the "toning-down" of the harsher aspects of the Mary Poppins character.  She also objected to the songs, and any suggestion of a romance between Mary and Bert. She so hated the animated sequences that she ruled out any further adaptations of the Mary Poppins books. Disney was unsuccessful in trying to persuade her otherwise.
Travers was not invited to the premiere, but asked Disney for permission to attend. At the premiere, she marched up to Disney and told him the animated sequences had to "go". Disney had the last word on the product, and said as he walked away, "Pamela, the ship has sailed." When a musical was being planned many years later, Travers refused to grant her permission for the adaptation should anyone associated with the movie be involved.

Story
The movie is about an eccentric and magical English nanny, her chimney sweep friend Bert, and two young children estranged from their busy father, a banker, and their mother, a suffragette. Poppins has the job of bringing the dysfunctional family together before she sails away on the wind.

Awards
The movie was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won five. Andrews won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance.
The movie received universal critical praise. Dick Van Dyke though was roundly takedn to task for his inauthentic Cockney accent.

In 2013, Mary Poppins was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
