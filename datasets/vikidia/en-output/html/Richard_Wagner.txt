Wagner's Festspielhaus in Bayreuth about 1900
Wagner wanted an opera house built for performances of The Ring of the Nibelung. The Ring consists of four separate operas that tell a complete story from German mythology. The Ring is usually performed over four evenings. Wagner's opera house (the Festspielhaus) was finally built in Bayreuth, Germany, in 1875. First performances of the complete Ring were held in 1876.
