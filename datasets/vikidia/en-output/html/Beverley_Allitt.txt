Beverley Allitt is an imprisoned female serial killer that focused on children from England.
She used her role as a nurse to murder 4 children, as well as trying to murder 3 others, and hurt a further 6, by giving them medicines they didn't need, and poisoning them with other chemicals.
She was found to be suffering from a mental illness called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy.
This type of illness makes the person suffering from it, want attention, and they seek that attention by hurting others,  and then pretending to be worried about them so that they look like kind people who are concerned about the hurt or sick person.
