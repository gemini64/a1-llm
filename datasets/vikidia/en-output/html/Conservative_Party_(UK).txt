The Conservative Party, also known as the Tories, is a political party in the United Kingdom. Its current leader is former prime minister Rishi Sunak. The Conservative Party is traditionally one of the two big British political parties; the other party is the Labour Party.
The Conservative Party is a centre-right party. This means the party is more right than the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party, but more left than the UK Independence Party. Former prime minister Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher were both members of the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party is originally a soft Eurosceptic party, who wanted to remain in the EU, but was against intensive collaboration between the EU member states. Since the 2016 referendum the party is divided by Brexit. There are wings in the party who want to remain in the EU and wings who want to leave the EU.
