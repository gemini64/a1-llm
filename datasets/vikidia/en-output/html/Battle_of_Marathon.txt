Plain of Marathon
The Battle of Marathon was a battle in 490 BC between the Athenian army and the forces of the Persian Empire. It was the culmination of the first Persian invasion of Greece under Darius I. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians.
The victory at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian force retreated to Asia. The Greeks realized with this victory that Persia could be defeated. The victory marked the beginning of the Classical Age in Greece.
The word "marathon" originates from this battle - in legend, a warrior called Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens to inform the people of Athens of the Greek victory.  He shouted the message and collapsed on the spot.  The exact distance from Marathon to Athens then became the name of a challenge, the marathon, which was to run that distance without collapsing as Pheidippides did. (*)
