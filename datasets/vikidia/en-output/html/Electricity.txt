Electricity is about electric charges. Both electrons and protons carry a charge. In electricity, negative charges build and then move to the positive region. The amount of the charge is the same for each particle, but opposite in sign.
Electrons have a negative charge while protons have positive charge. Everything around us contains a great many atoms. Every atom contains protons and electrons. The protons are located in the middle of the atom. They are located in a small area called the nucleus. The electrons revolve outside of the nucleus in orbits. The protons stay inside the nucleus. They cannot get out of there. Moving electrons that are responsible for making electricity.
