Birth and death
We don't know exactly when Thales (also known as Thales of Miletus) was born but we can say he was born in 624 B.C. in Miletus (now Balat, Turkey) and he died in 547 B.C.

His Theorem
WhyÂ ?
While Thales was in Egypt, he was supposedly able to determine the height of a pyramid.
How ?
By measuring the length of its shadow when the length of his own shadow was equal to his height.

Potential theorem
We suppose Thales created an other theorem about right-angled triangle in a circle. It consists in if a point is on a circle and the base is the diameter of this circle then the triangle is a right-angled triangle.
