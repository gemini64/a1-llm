Dyspraxia is a chronic (incurable) disability that effects hand-eye coordination and sometimes speech. People with dyspraxia sometimes have problems concentrating. Many dyspraxics have difficulty doing basic every-day things like tying their shoelaces, and cooking. Dyspraxic people usually have great long term memory, but bad short term memory. Some famous people have dyspraxia, like Daniel Radcliffe.
