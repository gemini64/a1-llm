Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central China, with a population of over eleven million, the ninth-most populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of China.
The name "Wuhan" came from the city's historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the "Three Towns of Wuhan" (武汉三镇). Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as "Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare" (九省通衢).
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, was first discovered in Wuhan. The city was the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020.
