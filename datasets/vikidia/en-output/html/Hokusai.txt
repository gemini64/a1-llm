self-portrait
Katsushika Hokusai   was a Japanese artist.  He lived from 1760 to 1849.  He used many different names in his work, but is better known today by his first name Hokusai.
He painted and made prints, and drew pictures for books. He was a master of printing pictures on paper using wood blocks.  His style, or school, of art was called  ukiyo-e which means "popular" in Japanese. By making multiple prints, they were affordable for masses of customers.
He made over 30 thousand pictures. His most famous sets of pictures are 36 Views of Fuji, and Mangwa.
Today, Hokusai is often remembered in the West for his picture The Great Wave (full name: The Great Wave off Kanagawa), one of the views of Mount Fuji.  He is now recognised as one of the most important artists of all time, due to his contributions to Asian art styles.
