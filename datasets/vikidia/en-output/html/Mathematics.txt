Mathematics is the combination of abstract knowledge resulting from logical reasoning applied to various objects such as man, form, structure, and transformation.
It is also the domain of knowledge that can develop knowledge, as well as the discipline that can be taught.

Arithmetic
Arithmetic is a branch of math where basic operations are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but also done in mathematical reasoning.

Addition
3 + 5 = 8 is an easy addition to kids of six years in kindergarten.
7391 + 3621 = 11012 is a medium addition to boys of eleven years in fifth grade.

Subtraction
9 - 4 = 5 is an easy subtraction to kids of seven years in first grade.
50918 - 41715 = 9203 is a medium subtraction to boys of eleven years in fifth grade.

Multiplication
6 * 3 = 18 is an easy multiplication to boys of eight years in second grade.
342 * 31 = 10602 is a medium multiplication to boys of eleven years in fifth grade.

Division
15 / 3 = 5 is an easy division to boys of nine years in third grade.
2187 / 81 = 27 is a medium division to boys of eleven years in fifth grade.

Geometry
Geometry is a branch of math that studies  the geometry forms.

Trigonometry
Trigonometry is a branch of geometry that studies the triangle.

Sinus
The sinus is the opposite hick divided by the hypotenuse.
The cosinus is the adjacent hick divided by the hypotenuse.

Tangent
The tangent is the opposite hick divided by the adjacent hick.
The cotangent is the opposite reason of tangent.

Secant
The secant is the opposite reason of cosinus.
The cosecant is the opposite reason of sinus.

Angles
The triangle who the angles are 90°, 60° and 30°, the constants is:
Adjacent hick to 60°: x. Adjacent hick to 30°: x(rad3) and the hypotenuse is 2x.

Quadrilateral
Four sides. The angles are alpha, beta, gamma and tit.

Square
Equal angles and equal sides.

Rhomboid
Two sides are equal and two angles are equal.

Diamond
A rhomboid who your upper angle is smaller than 90.

Rectangle
Equal angles and two equal sides.

Trapeze
Left and right sides are equal. Upper angles are equal and down angles are equal.

Trapezoid
No sides are equal.
