Varangian guard
The Varangian Guard was an elite unit of the Byzantine Army, from the 10th to the 14th centuries. Their members served as personal bodyguards to the Byzantine Emperors. At first, they were made up of Vikings. Later, after the Norman conquest of England, Anglo-Saxons joined the guard. For a time it caused an Anglo-Saxon emigration to Byzantium). (*)

History
In 874 peace was established between the Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. (*)  Kiev sent military assistance to Constantinople. By the early 10th century Kievan Rus were serving in the Byzantine army. In the summer of 987 the emperor Basil II asked for military help from Vladimir the Great, the  Grand prince of Kiev. (*)  They carried long handled battle-axes trimmed with gold. These weapons were their trademark. The sight of Varangian axemen on a battlefield meant the Emperor was close by.

(*)  Vladimir sent 6,000 men who arrived in the winter of 687. These were Viking soldiers who had not been paid and wanted to go to Byzantium where they hoped they could get pay. During Basil's campaigns, the Varangians (Vikings) proved to be an excellent fighting force. When Basil campaigned in Georgia and Armenia, he took 6,000 Varangians with him. During truce talks, a Varangian and a Georgian got into an argument. General fighting broke out and many were killed on both sides. The surviving Varangians formed the Varangian Guard. They wore uniforms of blue tunics with bright red cloaks.
