Alcide De Gasperi (born 3 April 1881, dead 19 August 1954) was Prime Minister of Italy from 1945 to 1953.
He promoted the idea of a peaceful Europe where states would come together and talk, negotiate and reach compromises.  He participated in the creation of the Council of Europe (1949). Regularly meeting Robert Schuman (French foreign minister) and Konrad Adenauer (West-German Chancellor), he supported the Schuman Declaration (May 1950) that would lead to the European Coal and Steel Community. He is recognized as one of 11 so-called "founding fathers of the European Union".
