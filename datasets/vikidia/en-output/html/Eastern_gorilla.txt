Eastern gorills in Uganda
The eastern gorilla (scientific name : Gorilla beringei) is a species of gorilla. It is the largest living primate.
The species is subdivided into two subspecies. The eastern lowland gorilla (G. b. graueri) is the most populous. This subspecies numbers about 5,000 individuals. The mountain gorilla (G. b. beringei) numbers about 700 individuals.
The Bwindi gorilla population (which numbers about half of the mountain gorilla population) may eventually be elevated to the rank of subspecies.
