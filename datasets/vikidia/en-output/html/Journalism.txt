Journalists recording an event
Journalism is the conveying of facts and information to help people understand the people around them and about their own lives. (*)  People who work in journalism jobs are called journalists. However, the Internet has made it much harder to define what journalism is. (*)  People with no experience and no qualifications represent themselves as journalists (reporters, commentators, news presenters). Their opinions are readily accepted without any regard for whether the information is true or not. This is based on the false assumption that if something is in print it must be true.
Journalism is includes delivering of news in newspapers, news shows on television, news shows on radio, and news magazines. There are many different news and information jobs in the field of journalism. In addition to reporters and news presenters, there are writers, editors, and photographers. (*)  Journalism also includes opinions on various subjects by knowledgeable journalists.
