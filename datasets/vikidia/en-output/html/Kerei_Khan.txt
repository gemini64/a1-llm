Kerei Khan (1424-1473), was the first Khan of the Kazakh Khanate from 1465 until death in 1473. He was the father of Bolat Sultan.
Although Kerei and Janibek are the khan of the Kazakh Khanate, Kerei holds the real power. After Kerei's death in 1473, Janibek became the only great khan. After Janibek's death in 1480, the successor to the Khan throne was Kerei's son Burunduk, but he was deposed by Janibek's son Kasym in 1511. After that, most of the Kazakh khans came from Janibek's direct line.
