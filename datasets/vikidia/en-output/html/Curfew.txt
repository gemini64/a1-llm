A Curfew is an act of law, placed upon individual people, and occasionally whole towns, cities and countries, preventing the people of those locations, doing certain things after a specific time of day.  It can also be placed upon people convicted of crimes, to prevent them leaving their homes between a certain time in the evening, and another time in the morning.  This is sometimes called House Arrest.
