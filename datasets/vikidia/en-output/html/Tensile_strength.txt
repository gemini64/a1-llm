Tensile strength measures the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks.
The tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can take before failure, for example breaking.
There are three typical definitions of tensile strength:

Yield strength - The stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation. This is not a sharply defined point. Yield strength is the stress which will cause a permanent deformation of 0.2% of the original dimension.



Ultimate strength - The maximum stress a material can withstand.



Breaking strength - The stress coordinate on the stress-strain curve at the point of rupture.



Typical tensile strengths
Some typical tensile strengths of some materials:



Note: Multiwalled carbon nanotubes have the highest tensile strength of any material yet measured, with labs producing them at a tensile strength of 63 GPa, still well below their theoretical limit of 300 GPa.  However, as of 2004, no macroscopic object constructed of carbon nanotubes has had a tensile strength remotely approaching this figure, or substantially exceeding that of high-strength materials like Kevlar.



Note: many of the values depend on manufacturing process and purity/composition.
