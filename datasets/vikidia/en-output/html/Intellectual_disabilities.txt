An intellectual disability or intellectual disability is the name for several developmental disabilities. Intellectual abilities are not normally developed in people with intellectual disabilities. Because of this they will not reach a normal level. People with an intellectual disability have a less well-developed thinking ability than their peers.
Intellectual disabilities come in many different forms.
Intellectual disabilities come in different shapes and sizes. So you have:
Mild intellectual disability: these are people with an IQ between 50 and 70. An IQ of 100 is normal on average. Many of these children attend special primary education (SBO).
Moderate intellectual disability: these are people with an IQ between 35 and 50. These children often end up at SBO or a school for Very Difficult Learners (ZML), which falls under special education.
Severe intellectual disability: this means that in addition to an IQ between 20 and 35, there is also minimal communication behavior (talking) and motor skills weak (moving). These children come to a ZML school and if there are motor problems, this can also be a Mytyl school or Tytyl school.
Profound Intellectual Disability: These are people with an IQ below 20. People who suffer from this have a very high need for a structured environment, sensory stimulation and a lot of supervision. Often there is poor speech and sometimes they cannot speak at all. These children go to a special shelter.
