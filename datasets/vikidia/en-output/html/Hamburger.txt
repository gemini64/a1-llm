Hamburger
Hamburger is a type of fast food. Mainly ketchup, mayonnaise, pickles, onions, tomatoes, mustard, etc. various items are offered in combination. Although the cutlet used in making it is mainly beef, there is also a great demand for those made from chicken. Cheese varieties (cheeseburgers) are also made.
Although it was patented by John T. Gregore of the United States in 1932, it has long been known that Vietnam, a country where the concept of patent has not yet spread, has had this type of food for centuries.
It is named after Hamburg, Germany.
