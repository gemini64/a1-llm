Mumps
Mumps is a viral disease of the human species. Some of the most commons symptoms can be fever, headaches, swelling of the parotid glands, sore throats, and orchitis (which means swelling of the testicles).
This can be diagnosed by the increase in alpha amylase isoenzymes in blood plasma.
The MMR vaccination stops measles, mumps and rubella.
Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus.
