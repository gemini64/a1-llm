Nótt is a goddess in Norse mythology associated with the night. Her name literally means "night" in Old Norse, and she personifies the concept of nighttime itself. While not one of the most prominent figures in the mythology, Nótt holds a significant place as a primordial being connected to the cycles of time.

Key Aspects of Nótt
Personification of Night: Nótt is the embodiment of the night, often depicted as a dark and shadowy figure who rides across the sky, bringing darkness as she goes. Her role is essential in the cosmic order, marking the balance between day and night.

Genealogy and Family
Nótt comes from a line of primordial beings:
Father: Her father is a giant named Narfi (sometimes referred to as Nörvi), another cosmic being.
Husbands and Children: Nótt had three marriages, each resulting in a significant child:
With Naglfari, she gave birth to Auðr.
With Annar, she had a daughter named Jörð, who is the personification of the Earth and the mother of Thor.
With Dellingr (a god of dawn or daylight), she gave birth to Dagr, who personifies day.
This lineage emphasizes the cosmic balance between night (Nótt), day (Dagr), and the earth (Jörð), with all these forces interacting as part of the natural world.

Nótt's Journey Across the Sky
Nótt rides across the heavens in a chariot pulled by a horse named Hrímfaxi ("frost mane"), which scatters dew across the land as it gallops through the night. She and her son Dagr alternate in their cosmic duty: after she brings the night, Dagr follows with the day, riding his own chariot drawn by the horse Skinfaxi ("shining mane").
Role in Norse Cosmology: Nótt is one of the few figures in Norse mythology directly linked to the fundamental elements of time and nature. She represents the dark, restful, and mysterious side of existence, just as her son Dagr represents the light and activity of the day. Together, they create the eternal cycle of day and night, essential for the rhythm of the cosmos.

Nótt’s Symbolism
Nótt is often associated with rest, the unknown, dreams, and the passage of time. Nighttime was a period of uncertainty and potential danger in ancient times, and Nótt embodies these aspects of human experience.
In contrast to more warlike gods, Nótt’s influence is subtle, tied to the natural order rather than conflict or conquest.

Depictions and Mentions
Nótt is mentioned in Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda, where her genealogy and role are outlined.
Her journey across the sky is described as part of the explanation for the origins of day and night in Norse cosmology.
