Old-fashioned Valentine's Day greeting card, 1860?
Valentine's Day is February 14. It is a day that commemorates two Christian martyrs named Valentine. The two of concern here are Valentine of Rome and Valentine of Terni.
Various tales about them were eventually reduced to one about a Christian priest who was kind to young sweethearts and signed his notes "Your loving Valentine". Valentine was beheaded by the Roman Emperor for marrying young couples against the law.
In the modern world, the day is a secular celebration. Sweethearts enjoy boxes of chocolates, send greeting cards, and buy bouquets of roses.
