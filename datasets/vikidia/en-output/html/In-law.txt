An in-law is someone who you are related to through marriage.
This includes the close relatives of one's spouse (husband or wife) or the spouses and sometimes even close relatives of one's close relatives.
For example, a sibling-in-law (usually brother/sister-in-law) is the sibling of your spouse or the spouse of your sibling.
A parent-in-law (usually father/mother-in-law) is the parent of your spouse. The spouse of your parent to whom you are not descended from is called a stepparent (stepfather/stepmother).
A child-in-law (usually son/daughter-in-law) is the spouse of one of your children. A child of your spouse whom are not biologically descended from you are called a stepchild (stepson/stepdaughter).
