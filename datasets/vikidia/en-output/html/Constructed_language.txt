A constructed language, also known as a conlang, is a language that was created as a result of extensive planning, rather than developing naturally over time.

Why people create constructed languages

There are several different reasons people create constructed languages. There are 3 main types of conlags.

Engineered languages (engelangs) - designed for experimental purposes
Auxiliary languages (auxlangs) - designed to make international communication easier
Artistic languages (artlangs) - designed to look or sound pretty, or just for fun.


The most spoken constructed language is Esperanto, an auxlang, which has around two million speakers. Some constructed languages are also created for use in fiction, for example Klingon from the Star Trek universe.
