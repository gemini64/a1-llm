Whitman in the frontispiece of Leaves of Grass
Walter "Walt" Whitman (May 31, 1819 â€“ March 26, 1892) was an American poet. He passed most of his life in New York City and the surrounding area. His greatest work is the monumental Leaves of Grass (1855). Whitman added to this collection throughout his life. (*)
Memorable poems from Leaves of Grass include "O Captain! My Captain!" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd". Both poems are reflections upon the American Civil War and the death of Abraham Lincoln. (*)   Both are poems about nature based on his experiences with his wife, Narcissa, traveling into the unsettled northwestern United States. (*)
