History
People have lived in the area around Francistown for over 10,000 years. In the 19th century, it was a village where the BaKalanga people lived. In 1867, a gold prospector named Karl Mauch found the BaKalanga people mining gold along the Tati River. This discovery led to Southern Africa's first gold rush. The town was named after Daniel Francis, an English prospector who got permission to search for gold in the area in 1869  (*) .
