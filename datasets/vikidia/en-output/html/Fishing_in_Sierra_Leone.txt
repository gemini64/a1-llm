Sierra Leone, situated on the western coast of Africa, boasts a rich cultural heritage and a diverse range of aquatic/marine resources. The integration of the native fishing industry in Sierra Leone has been a significant aspect of its history and economy. In this article, we will throw light on the historical context of Sierra Leone's Integration of native fishing practices; examine key figures who have contributed to the field, and present a Case Study in three (3) Rural/Western Area Communities. We will also shed light and provide some analysis of both positive and negative effects, while also considering potential future developments related to Sierra Leone’s Integration of native fishing.

Historical Background of the Integration of Sierra Leone Native Fishing.
To understand the importance of Sierra Leone's Integration of Native fishing, it is crucial to explore its historical context. Indigenous/native fishing practices have been an integral part of Sierra Leonean culture for centuries, supporting both subsistence and commercial livelihoods. The country's abundant coastline and rich marine resources have sustained local communities and facilitated trade with neighbouring regions.
Sierra Leone's integration of fishing historically relied on traditional methods, such as hand-line/hook-line fishing nets, fishing boats, basket traps, water fencing, and other native fishing devices. These practices were passed down through generations, symbolizing the deep connection between Sierra Leonean communities and their surroundings. The fishing traditions were deeply interconnected/related to cultural ceremonies, with songs, dances, and storytelling celebrating the bountiful/abundant harvest of the sea.

Key Figures and Contributions to Sierra Leone Integrated Native Fishing

Throughout history, several individuals have made notable contributions to Sierra Leone's Integration of the native fishing industry. These key figures have played a vital role in shaping the industry, promoting sustainability, and improving livelihoods. In this article we will mention two notable Sierra Leonean. One such influential individual is Dr.Augustine Kamara, a renowned marine biologist who dedicated his life to studying Sierra Leone's marine ecosystem and advocating for sustainable fishing practices.
Dr.Kamara's research shed light on the importance of protecting vulnerable species, conserving habitats, and implementing proper fishing regulations. His efforts led to the establishment of marine protected areas, providing a sanctuary for fish populations to thrive and ensuring the long-term viability of Sierra Leone's native fishing industry.
Another significant figure in the integration of Sierra Leone native fishing is Mama Adama Kamara, a fisherwoman who championed women's rights in the industry. By empowering women to participate in fishing activities, Mama Adama Kamara challenged gender norms, improved economic opportunities for women, and contributed to the overall development of fishing communities. Her efforts led to a stronger and more inclusive fishing sector, benefiting both individuals and the broader society.

We were privileged to represent our school and colleagues at Prep. Six (6) of the Providence International Elementary School to make a Field trip to Gbendembu, Funkia Wharf in the Goderich Community located in the Western Rural District and Murray Town Fishing Community in the Western Area in Freetown on Friday 12th, Saturday 13th, and Monday 15th January 2024. A Team of colleagues of four (4) in number joined by our Assistant Head Teacher and three (3) teaching staff who were the coordinating team of the Write-top of the Article “Fishing Integration in Sierra Leone – A Case Study in the Western Rural/Urban Fishing Communities paid a visit to the above-named communities.
It was a trip that was sponsored by the school’s administration. The primary motive/objective of the field trip was geared towards providing us the experience and understanding of the daily life of the inhabitants in these fishing communities after which we were to write an article based on our experience on the topic indicated above for the Wikichallenge 2023 Competition sponsored by Orange Foundation. The trip took us 30 to 35 minutes each day based on the traffic pattern for that day. We arrived at around 10:00 am on the first day, 10:50 am on the second day, and 8:40 am on the final day. We were greeted with the smell of both raw and roasted fish each day of our arrival which indicates that Gbendembu, Funkia and Murray Town are fishing communities. Murray Town is a settlement found within the Western part of Freetown, in the Western Area and Gbendembu and Funkia are settlements found within the Goderich community around the peninsula in the Western Rural District. These three communities are cosmopolitan communities with over 1,000 - 1500 households but due to urbanization, they have an approximate population of over 5,000 – 6,000 inhabitants. These are communities that are found along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the major economic activity for men is fishing while the women are mostly engaged in petty trading. As fishing communities, Gbendembu, Funkia and Murray Town Wharfs are major fishing communities in Freetown. On our arrival each day, we always met with both fishermen and fishmongers and even buyers who were willing to take us through and provide us with an experience of their daily lives.
From the stories narrated to us, Fishermen mostly start their day before sunrise as they believe that is the time they will be able to make good catch. However, for others, they believe in going out at night. Whatever the time may be, the daily life of the fishermen starts with the mending of their nets, metal hooks, and their boats and outboard engines which are among the most important tools of their fishing trade. It is after when these tools have been certified that they will embark on their journey to sea.
According to them, they are usually directed by the red and blue water wave path. It is through this path that their nets are cast. Nets cast take a while to allow fishes to take the bait. They usually don't have time as to how long the nets take before it is being pulled up. When the fishermen feel satisfied, the net is then drawn to the boat to ascertain the number of catches made. While some fishing activities may take the whole day or night, some may take hours depending on how satisfied the fishermen are.
Returning from a daily or night catch, these fishermen are welcomed at the wharf by fishmongers or interested buyers who come along to buy the fish from them. Upon arrival, the fish are sorted and sold out in terms of their sizes and values.  On the part of the fishmongers, selling fish also involves a process. While some are sold raw, others are smoked as a form of preservation method. For those to be sold raw, fishmongers need ice to keep them fresh for the buyers.
Even though the fishing trade might be exciting to these fishermen and fishmongers, it is a trade with its challenges. Exposure to cold is also a major challenge for fishermen as well as fishmongers. Being on the sea without any strong protection from the heavy wind and sometimes stormy/rainy weather put their lives at risk.
While for the fishmongers playing with ice exposes them to cold. Thus suffering from pneumonia is a common sickness for fishermen and exposure to smoke while smoking of the fish. This is mostly done through local and manual means using firewood. Inhaling this smoke is a threat to the lungs.
Our three-day trips were exciting, fun-filled, educative, and mind-blowing. We must confess that this is our first time visiting Murray Town and Funkia fishing communities. It is an experience that has taught us that every livelihood activity must be respected. Thanks to our school and teachers for allowing us to have this life experience. We also want to thank the Orange Foundation and representative here in Sierra Leone for giving us the opportunity to participate in the Wikichallenge Competition 2023.

Negative Aspects of Integration of Native Fishing in Sierra Leone
1. Risk of exploitation.
There will be a risk of an influx of external actors seeking to exploit the country's marine resources without consideration for sustainable practices or equitable economic benefits. This can lead to overfishing, depletion of fish stocks, and the marginalization of local fishing communities.
2.  Risk to the Environment and the local communities
The integration of native fishing or Sustainable Livelihoods, has had some negative effects on both the environment and the local communities. While the intentions behind this integration may be noble, it is important to understand the repercussions it has had. One of the main negative effects is the decline in fish populations. This is a result of overfishing practices that some natives engage in due to increased demand and pressure to make a living. As a result, it disrupts the ecological balance and threatens the sustainability of fishing in the long run.
3. Risk of Conflict and increase in poverty
Additionally, the integration of native fishing has led to the displacement of local communities who depend on fishing as their primary source of income. This has caused a rise in poverty and social unrest among these communities. The competition for resources and employment has intensified, leading to conflicts among different groups of fishermen. The integration has ultimately divided communities and disrupted the social fabric that was once cohesive.
4. Introduction of Modern Fishing Technics
Furthermore, the introduction of modern fishing techniques and technology has also negatively impacted native fishing. Traditional methods that were once sustainable and did not harm the environment have been replaced by more efficient, yet destructive methods. For instance, the use of large-scale trawlers and dynamite fishing has resulted in widespread damage to coral reefs and other marine habitats. This damage not only affects the delicate balance of the ecosystem but also diminishes the future viability of fish populations.

5. Loss of Tradition and Cultural Fishing Practices
Moreover, the integration of native fishing has led to the loss of traditional knowledge and cultural practices. As young people increasingly turn away from traditional fishing practices and adopt modern methods, the wisdom passed down from generations is being forgotten. This loss of cultural heritage is concerning, as it disconnects communities from their roots and erodes the sense of identity and belonging.

6. Influence of External Markets
Another negative effect is the reliance on external markets. With the integration of native fishing, there has been an increased focus on exporting fish to meet the demands of the global market. This has created a dependency on external markets, leaving the local communities vulnerable to fluctuations and fluctuations in prices. When prices drop, it directly impacts the income and livelihoods of these fishermen, pushing them deeper into poverty.
7. Pollution
Moreover, the pollution caused by fishing practices has escalated due to the integration of native fishing. The use of non-biodegradable materials, such as plastic nets and lines, contributes to the accumulation of marine debris. This pollution harms marine life, disrupts ecosystems, and can be detrimental to human health when contaminated fish are consumed.
9. Large Scale of Fishing affects Natural Fish Stock Balance.
Additionally, the bulk extraction of fish for commercial purposes has caused an imbalance in the food chain. Removing large quantities of fish disrupts the natural balance and leads to the proliferation of certain species while others decline. This can have cascading effects on the ecosystem, impacting other marine creatures dependent on the fish population for survival.
10. Pressure on Fish Stocks
Furthermore, the integration of native fishing has increased the pressure on already fragile fish stocks. The demand for fish, both locally and internationally, has skyrocketed, leading to unsustainable fishing practices. This not only threatens the survival of certain fish species but also disrupts the natural ecosystems and can result in a collapse of the fishing industry altogether.
11. Health Risk
Moreover, the increased competition and commercialization of fishing have also had negative effects on fishing communities' mental health and their overall well-being. The constant pressure to meet the demands of the market, coupled with the decline in fish populations, has led to stress, anxiety, and mental health issues among fishermen. They often have to work longer hours under cold weather conditions, and heavy storms, take higher risks of getting cold/pneumonia, and also face uncertain futures, taking a toll on their overall well-being.
Lastly, the integration of native fishing has inadvertently contributed to the marginalization of indigenous cultures and communities. The shift towards market-oriented fishing practices leaves traditional fishing methods undervalued and underappreciated. This not only threatens the livelihoods of indigenous people but also disregards their rights and knowledge systems, perpetuating a cycle of exclusion and discrimination.
In Conclusion, the integration of native fishing practices in Sierra Leone provides a sustainable solution that aligns conservation efforts with cultural preservation and economic growth. By embracing these techniques, coastal communities can ensure the survival of their cultural heritage while protecting the marine ecosystem. Through government support, public awareness, and international collaboration, Sierra Leone can lead the way in sustainable fishing practices, empowering coastal communities, and safeguarding its unique biodiversity.
