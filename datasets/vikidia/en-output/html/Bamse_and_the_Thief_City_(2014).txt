Bamse And The City Of Thieves (Swedish: Bamse och Tjuvstaden) is a 2014 Swedish animated feature film directed by Christian Ryltenius after an original script by Jon Nohrstedt, using Tomas Tivemark's already well-established characters. It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 2013, Bamse and the Witch's Daughter (2016). This is the first time since before 2012 where a Bamse production features voice acting by others than only Johan Kindblom himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well.
