The Immaculate Conception is the catholic belief  that the Virgin Mary did not inherit the original sin that is in any other human being since Adam and Eve ate the Forbidden Fruit in Paradise.
This belief is different from the virginal conception of Jesus, the belief that Mary became pregnant  without sexual intercourse.
