GIMP (acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free image editing software. It can be used to edit raster or bitmap image file formats, such as PNG, GIF, JPEG, and TIFF.
GIMP is both free in price and free in copyright. It is also open source, which means anyone can look at its source code. For these reasons, GIMP is a popular free alternative to Adobe Photoshop.
The software is cross-platform, available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and more.
