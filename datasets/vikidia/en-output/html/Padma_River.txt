The Padma River originates from the Ganges and Jamuna rivers near Shibganj in Bangladesh. From its origin, the Padma flows southward, forming the main stem of the Ganges Delta. The river is approximately 120 kilometres wide at its confluence with the Meghna River, another major regional river.

Course
The Padma River has a meandering course, traversing through the fertile plains of Bangladesh. Its waters are heavily utilized for agriculture, providing vital irrigation for the region's rice paddies and other crops. As the river flows southward, it is joined by numerous tributaries, contributing to its volume and significance.

Economic Importance
The Padma River is of immense economic importance to the people of Bangladesh and the surrounding areas. The fertile floodplains along its banks support a thriving agricultural sector, with rice being a primary crop. Fishing is also a significant economic activity, with numerous fish species thriving in the river's waters. The river is a crucial transportation route for goods and people, facilitating trade and commerce.

Ecosystem
The Padma River and its surrounding wetlands form a diverse ecosystem supporting rich biodiversity. The river is home to various fish species, including hilsa, catfish, and carp, contributing significantly to the local diet. The wetlands along its banks provide habitats for numerous bird species, making it a vital area for birdwatching and ecological research.

Environmental Challenges
Despite its importance, the Padma River faces several environmental challenges. Pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and urban waste threatens the river's water quality. Additionally, deforestation and land-use changes in the river basin contribute to soil erosion and alter the river's natural flow.

Cultural Significance
The Padma River holds cultural and religious significance in the region. Many festivals and rituals are associated with the river, and its waters are considered sacred by the people of Bangladesh. The river also features prominently in literature, folklore, and traditional art forms, reflecting its profound cultural impact.
