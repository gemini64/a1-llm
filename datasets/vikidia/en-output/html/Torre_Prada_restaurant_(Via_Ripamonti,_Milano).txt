Ristorante Torre is a restaurant located at Via Giovanni Lorenzini, 14, corner of Via Ripamonti in Milan, Italy, owned by Prada, with 50s décor design, refined and retro-futurist aesthetic. The restaurant housed on the sixth floor of the Prada Foundation building was designed by Rem Koolhaas in 2018.

History
Restaurant Torre was opened in 2019 by Miuccia Prada, in the fastest growing district of the city of Milan, considered a second alternative center to Via Monte Napoleone by international high luxury fashion designers. A few steps away are the head quarters with the buildings of Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton, Jil Sanders, Renzo Rosso, Moncler, etc.
The Restaurant of Prada wanted to recreate a "Milanese" bar from the 1950s,
taking inspiration from the vintage luxury of the starchitects of the 1950s who created the iconic buildings of the exclusive Quadronno district. Considered the 4th most expensive neighborhood in all of Italy, the considered period of the birth of Italian design and then appreciated all over the world.
On the top level we can recognize original furnishings from the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York designed by Philip Johnson in 1958, while the walls with artist's dishes are inspired by the tradition of the Italian restaurant.
In the room there are two works by Lucio Fontana, who like Umberto Boccioni frequented the neighborhood, the Fireplace Hood (1949) and Head of Medusa (1948-54), while the polychrome ceramic Pilastro (1947).
The restaurant's bar features a selection of artwork by Thomas Demand, Jeff Koons, Goshka Macuga and John Wesley, and elements of Carsten Höller's installation The Double Club (2008-2009).
