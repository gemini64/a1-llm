Striped Skunk
A Skunk is a mammal. They are most often black and white in colour, though some are brown or even ginger coloured.
When they are scared or threatened, they spray a liquid from special glands under their tails.  This liquid smells very bad and is meant to scare off anything which is attempting to hurt or attack the Skunk.  The smell can last for several days on clothes, skin and fur. Many different treatments and old wives tales exist as to how to get rid of the smell, including bathing in tomato juice.
