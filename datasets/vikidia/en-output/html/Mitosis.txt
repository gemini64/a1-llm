Mitosis can be defined as a process of dividing a cell to create two cells with identical or nearly identical DNA.  It is used by most one-celled organisms to reproduce and by cells in multi-cellular organisms to repair the body or to grow.
Mitosis is very similar to meiosis, but is distinguished from it as form 2 daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes of the mother cell. Meiosis concern somatic cells of the body and the germ cells.

Stages of mitosis
Mitosis is divided into six stages:

prophase
prometaphase
metaphase
anaphase
telophase
cytokinesis, it is different from others because it affect not only the nucleus, but the whole cell.



Prophase
In this phase there is the condensation of the chromatin.

Prometaphase
a) The chromosomal microtubules connect to the kinetochore of chromosome
b) The chromosomes move toward the equator of the molten

Metaphase
This phase begins by prometaphase where there is the dissolution of the nuclear membrane, which breaks into many vesicles. This process is created by phosphorylation, through the kinase, the laminae of the proteins that constitute the nuclear blade.

Anaphase
During anaphase, the brother chromatids separate from each other and sent to the two centrosomes. They identify two times, called anaphase A and B.

Telophase
In this last phase of mitosis, the chromosomes disperse. Around the two new complex chromosomal reappear nuclear membranes and organelles are recomposed.

Citophase
Typically, mitosis followed by cytokinesis, a process that divides the cytoplasm dividing it into two new cells.
