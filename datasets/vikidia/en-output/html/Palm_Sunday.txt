Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (1320) by Pietro Lorenzetti: entering the city on a donkey symbolizes arrival in peace rather than as a war-waging king arriving on a horse
Palm Sunday is a holiday in the Christian world. It commemorates the entry of Jesus into the city of Jerusalem during the last days of his life.
Palm Sunday is a "moveable feast." It always falls on the Sunday one week before Easter, but not the same Sunday every year.
Celebrations in the Christian world involve worshippers carrying blessed palm leafs in procession around a church. In some places, children go door to door dressed as witches asking for candy.
