Communism (from the Latin word communis meaning "common" and "universal") is originally the concept of a social organisation without social classes, state and money. Ownership of the the means of production (factories, farmland, housing) would be shared by the workers.
From there, it became a political system that guided the government in several countries for some decades, mostly in the second half of the 20th century. However, as a political system, it was never implemented in these countries, and instead only socialism or state capitalism was achieved. In those countries, the State existed and owned the resources on behalf of the working class.
Its economic aspects were often opposed to those of capitalism.
