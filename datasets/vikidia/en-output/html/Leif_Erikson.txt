Statue of Leif Ericson (1888) by Anne Whitney at in Veterans Park, Milwaukee
Leif Erikson (c. 970 â€“ c. 1020) was a Norse explorer and colonizer. He is regarded as the first European to land in North America (excluding Greenland), nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus. He discovered and colonized a land called "Vinland", possibly a portion of Canada.
Erikson was probably born in Iceland as the son of Erik the Red, an explorer and outlaw in the Viking world. Erikson had at least two sons. He converted from Norse paganism to Christianity.
