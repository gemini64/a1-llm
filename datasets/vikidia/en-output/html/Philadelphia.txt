Skyline of Philadelphia
Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania and the fifth largest in the United States. In 2013, the population of the city proper was 1,553,165. (*)  In 2011, the urban area had 5.927 million people. (*)  The city's name is from Greek Φιλαδέλφεια, which means "brotherly love".

History
Philadelphia was an early capital of William Penn's Pennsylvania colony, though the capital is now Harrisburg.  Benjamin Franklin moved from Boston to Philadelphia during the American Revolution, and the city's Independence Hall was the meeting site of the Continental Congress, rendering the city to be America's first capital.  The Liberty Bell is kept in Philadelphia.  The city later became an East Coast end for railway lines connecting to the west, and became very rich with coal, as much is found in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania.  Today the city grows into New Jersey and forms a massive urban area with New York City.

Geography
Philadelphia is located at the east end of Pennsylvania, on the Delaware River, which forms the border with New Jersey.  Across the river is the town of Camden. (*)
