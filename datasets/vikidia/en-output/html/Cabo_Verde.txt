History
A resort in Cabo Verde
Cape Verde was uninhabited when the Portuguese in 1460 Diego Gomes and Antonio Nolas reached the Islands and made them part of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese settled in 1462 in Santiago and in 1587 became the Islands group is a Portuguese colony. The Islands formed among other things an important location for the slave trade. The population of Cape Verde is, therefore, the result of a mix of Portuguese colonists and African slaves.
Ships on their way from Europe to all corners of the world who landed here beat water, poultry, and vegetables. In return gave the sailors to the Cape Verdeans usually non-articles such as pipes, tobacco but also clothing. This is evidenced by the travelogues of the South Dutch traveler Jan Frans Michel. His Chronicles are an important source in connection with the history of this country. In 1752 he was in transit to China and spent 11 days in Cape Verde. Also, the British pirate Woodes Rogers reported extensively about the State of the country in the beginning of the 18th century.
On 5 July 1975 Cape Verde was eventually independent of Portugal; the socialist Aristides Pereira became the first president. He was twice re-elected before the country got a multiparty system in 1990. Pereira was succeeded by the Democrat Ant√≥nio Mascarenhas Monteiro, who in turn was succeeded in 2001 by Pedro Pires. The current president is Jorge Carlos Fonseca.
