The Bahamas, or Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an independent, English-speaking country in the Caribbean. The name is derived from the Spanish words Baja Mar (shallow sea).

Geography
The Bahamas consist of an archipelago of 700 islands and cays 2000 (or keys = sand/coral plates), which is located in the Atlantic Ocean, East of the State of Florida, North of Cuba and Haiti, and West of the British Turks and Caicos Islands. The country has more than 300,000 inhabitants on an area of 13,878 km² (similar to the surface of the Flemish region).
Of all the Islands there are only 30 to 40 inhabited. The largest island is Andros on about 180 kilometers southeast of Florida. The Bimini Islands are located to the Northwest of it. To the North is Grand Bahama with the second-largest city: Freeport. Great Abaco is located east of. The second largest island of Great Inagua is located in the South. Other islands include Eleuthera, Cat, San Salvador, Acklins, Crooked Island and Mayaguana.
The underwater world of the Bahamas is known for its wealth of large predatory fish including many species of shark. Presumably makes the variation of sandy bottoms, coral reefs, mangrove forests and the warm Gulf stream from the Atlantic Ocean the seas around the Islands an ideal habitat for these fish. There is also no question of large-scale industrial pollution of sea water.
