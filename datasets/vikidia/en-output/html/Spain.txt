There is another issue facing Spain's parliament and political system; the Catalan Parliament wants to declare Catalonia's independence from Spain, which would make it a separate country.  They already tried to do this once, through a public referendum, but the person who was Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, ruled that the vote organised by the Catalan Parliament was against Spain's constitution and ruled it illegal.
The referendum still went ahead without the Spanish government's permission.  The leader of the Catalan Parliament, Carles Puigdemont, announced the result and declared Catalonia independent.  However, this was rejected by the Spanish government and it lead to serious riots in the territory, in which lots of people were hurt.  The Catalan Parliament was suspended and some of its senior members were arrested. They are currently on trial on a charge of sedition; this means that they're being tried for speaking or behaving in a way which causes people to rebel against a government or a monarch.  Carles Puigdemont is currently in exile in Belgium, to avoid being arrested.
Spain has one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU.
