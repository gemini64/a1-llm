Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning (or Baldi's Basics Classic and simply Baldi's Basics) is a 2018 horror puzzle game created by Micah McGonigal, also known as mystman12. In a schoolhouse, the player needs to find seven notebooks filled with math problems, all while avoiding Baldi, his friends, and obstacles. The game became popular for its hard gameplay, old-school graphics, and strange humor. The game makes fun of 1990s educational games, turning them into horror. This theme is expanded in updated versions, like Baldi's Basics Classic Remastered.
