The Nile crocodile (scientific name : Crocodylus niloticus) is the second largest reptile in the world, after the saltwater crocodile. This crocodile is found in the eastern, southern, and central areas of Africa. It lives in freshwater lakes, rivers, and marshlands.
The Nile crocodile is between 4.1 metres (13 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft) in length, and weighs around 410 kg (900 lb). However, specimens measuring 6.1 metres (20 ft) in length and weighing 907 kg (2,000 lb) have been recorded.
The Nile crocodile has thick scaly skin that is heavily armored. It eats many things including fish, reptiles, birds, and even mammals. It will ambush its prey and may wait in hiding for hours, days, or even weeks to catch its meal. The Nile crocodile has a powerful bite, and can drag a large animal underwater to drown it.
These crocodiles are very social and spends its time basking in the sun with other Nile crocodiles. The female lays her eggs, and guards the nest. When the babies hatch, she leaves them to fend for themselves. The Nile crocodile is one of the most dangerous species of crocodile and is responsible for hundreds of deaths of humans every year. It is not endangered.
