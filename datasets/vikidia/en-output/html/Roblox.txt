Origins of Roblox
Roblox came to be when David Bazucki and Erik Cassel started working on a piece 2D modeling software. It was released under the name of Interactive Physics, but they thought that if it was 3D, it would be better. So in 2003-2004, they started working on Roblox. In 2004, they released a small beta of Roblox called Dynablocks, and finally, in 2006, Roblox released to the public.
