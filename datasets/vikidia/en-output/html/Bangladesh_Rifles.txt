The Bangladesh Rifles, now known as the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), is a paramilitary force responsible for guarding the borders of Bangladesh. Established on March 27, 1971, the BDR underwent a name change and restructuring in 2010 following a mutiny within its ranks. The force primarily plays a crucial role in maintaining border security, preventing smuggling, and ensuring territorial integrity.

History:
The Bangladesh Rifles originated from the East Pakistan Rifles, a paramilitary force established in 1948 during the time when Bangladesh was part of Pakistan. After the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, the force was reconstituted as the Bangladesh Rifles to reflect the newly independent nation's identity.

Roles and Responsibilities:
The primary duties of the Bangladesh Rifles, now the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), include:

Border Security: The BGB is tasked with safeguarding the borders of Bangladesh, preventing illegal activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and other transnational crimes.
Internal Security: In addition to border security, the BGB is often called upon to assist civil authorities in maintaining law and order during times of national emergencies or natural disasters.
Peacekeeping Missions: Bangladesh Rifles personnel have actively participated in various international peacekeeping missions, contributing to global peace and security under the United Nations.



Restructuring and Name Change:
In 2009, the Bangladesh Rifles faced a significant internal crisis when a mutiny erupted within its ranks. The mutiny resulted in the death of several military officers. In the aftermath, the force underwent a comprehensive restructuring process. As a part of these reforms, the Bangladesh Rifles was renamed the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in 2010. The restructured force aimed to enhance professionalism, discipline, and overall effectiveness.

Training and Collaboration:
The BGB emphasizes continuous training to enhance the skills and capabilities of its personnel. The force often collaborates with other national and international security agencies to benefit from shared expertise and best practices.

Controversies:
The 2009 mutiny and subsequent events led to a considerable controversy and raised questions about internal discipline and the relationship between military and paramilitary forces in Bangladesh.
