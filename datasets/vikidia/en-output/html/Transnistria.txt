Transnistria is a region in eastern Moldova. It is a narrow strip 120 mi long but only 20 mi wide.
The people who live there are mostly Russian and Ukrainian.

Geopolitical status
The region wants to leave the country of Moldova and become an independent country. In the early 1990s a republic was declared but it has not been recognized by most countries in the world. A peace accord with Moldova was signed in 1997 giving the region more power to rule itself.
