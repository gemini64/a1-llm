Coffee is a drink made by brewing coffee beans with boiling water. It is usually served hot, but it is sometimes served with ice cubes (iced coffee). Coffee contains caffeine, which gives people more energy. This is why coffee is normally drunk in the morning. The country that is the largest producer of coffee is Brazil.
