3D slash is a website for making 3D models. Children 0-17 years old must be accompanied by an adult if they choose to register. But it is child safe. So stick to being Non Registered unless you have an adult. So for children this can get complicated. There is several tools to use like breaking parts of a 3d shape or coloring it. You can export it by a screenshot if Non Registered. Registered Users (If under 18 must be accompanied by an adult) can save there work without taking a screenshot. Zoom Out to 50% to see the image below. The numbers next to the circles are how many mm (millimeters) you want for size. Drawing size is the same thing and so as breaking blocks and adding blocks. Red Circles mean that itâ€™s a premium size (Usually really small ones).
