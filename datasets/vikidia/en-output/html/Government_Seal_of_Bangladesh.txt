Government Seal of Bangladesh
The Government of Bangladesh and the Cabinet of Bangladesh use a seal in their official functions. This seal is also found on the cover page of Bangladeshi passports. It was designed after Bangladesh's first flag, used during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The seal contains the words "People's Republic of Bangladesh" in Bengali above the outer white part and below it, "government", along with four red 5-pointed stars, two on either side. The design also includes a map of Bangladesh in yellow with a red circle in the centre. Nithyananda Saha designed the seal.

History of Monograms
The Provisional Government of the First People's Republic of Bangladesh adopted the seal, also known as the Mujibnagar Government. This government was formed in early April 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War in Kolkata, India. It served as the government-in-exile of Bangladesh and declared the independence of Bangladesh. The Mujibnagar Government confirmed Bengali nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration of independence for East Pakistan on March 26 of the same year.
