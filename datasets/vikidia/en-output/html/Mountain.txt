A mountain is a rise in the earth's surface. The definition of how tall a mountain is varies, but it is generally considered to be about 2,000 ft (about 600 m).
The highest mountain on earth is Mount Everest, located in the Himalayas of Asia, at 29,029 ft (8,848 m) above sea level. However, the tallest mountain is Mauna Kea of Hawaii, which stretches from the ocean floor of the Pacific Ocean to 13,802 ft (4,207 m) above sea level, for a total height of 33,474 ft (10,203 m).
Mountains are also on other planets. Olympus Mons, the highest mountain on Mars and one of the highest in the Solar System, is nearly 14 mi (22 km) high.
