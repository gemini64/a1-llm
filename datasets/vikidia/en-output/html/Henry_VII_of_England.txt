Henry Tudor
Henry VII of England (or Henry Tudor; 28 January 1457 â€“ 21 April 1509) was king of England from 1485 to 1509. He was the first monarch of the Tudor dynasty. He was followed to the throne of England by his son, Henry VIII of England.
The War of the Roses was fought by the House of Lancaster and the House of York. These two great families contested the succession to the throne of England. Henry became king following the death of the Yorkist King Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Henry had small claim to the throne, but married Elizabeth of York, Richard III's niece, and thus secured his claim to the throne.
