Corona viral disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a newly discovered type of corona virus. Most people with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

How it spreads
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through water particles produced by the cough, sneeze or discharge of an infected person. These droplets are too heavy to float in the air and that is why they quickly fall to the floor or surface.
If you are in close contact with a person infected with COVID-19, you may be infected by inhaling the virus or touching a contaminated area and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
