Mangos are a type of sweet tropical fruit, and it is also the name of the trees on which the fruit grows on. Ripe mangoes are juicy, fleshy and most of all, delicious. Normally to eat a mango, you can whiz it up into a smoothie or get a knife and cut it up into little cubes, push it in, and BOOM you got yourself a mango that you can eat. They are very fleshy and chewy, and the first time you try it you may not like it, but don't let that stop you, though, because they are delicious once you are used to them!
Mangoes are a summer type of fruit, typically popular in Australia around Christmas time, because around that time, it is summer, and like I said, mango is practically a tropical, summery fruit.
