Evolution

Alpacas, llamas, vicuna and guanaco are four camelids present in South America; the first two were tamed. Until some time ago it was thought that both the blade and the alpaca derived from the guanaco. The genetic material has been examined, if they confirm that the vigognia is the descendant of the alpaca, the discovery will lead to the reclassification of the alpaca.
