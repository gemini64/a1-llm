The phrase "Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un" is a Quranic verse that supplicates in Bengali, meaning "We belong to Allah and surely to Him we return." This Arabic phrase is commonly known as 'Istirja' and is often recited by Muslims to express their sorrow, mainly when a Muslim individual passes away.
