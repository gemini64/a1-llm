Super Mario Bros. Wonder takes the familiar cast of the games and reunites them as they leave the Mushroom Kingdom. Their destination is the Flower Kingdom, a new world with new visuals and some wild secrets of its own. The game is not an add on to the New Super Mario Bros. series, which ran from 2006-2018. Super Mario Wonder outshines New Super Mario Bros by providing a broader array of gameplay variety that keeps players engaged for an extended period.

Story
Mario and his friends are invited to the Flower Kingdom to visit it, but Bowser was obviously there to cause trouble. Can they stop him?
