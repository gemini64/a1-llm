A Season is a period of the year which lasts for different lengths of time, and demonstrates different types of weather, different plants and other features. There are 4 seasons in a year.

Spring -  this is the most beautiful season of the year, when lots of flowers appear, like Crocuses and Snowdrops.
Summer -  this is the hottest season, when you can find lots of fruit and lots of people go on vacation.
Autumn -  this is when leaves fall from the trees and the nights start to get colder.  During this season, Horse Chestnuts drop to the floor, which children use for a game called Conkers, a colloquial word also given to the Horse Chestnut.
Winter -  this is when snow falls.  Most trees are bare and the days are generally very cold.  Winter is the coldest of the four seasons.
