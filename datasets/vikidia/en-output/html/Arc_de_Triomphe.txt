The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile (English: Triumphal Arch of the Star) is a monument in Paris, the capital of France. It is located at the Place Charles de Gaulle at the end of the Champs-Élysées. The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most recognizable monuments of Paris as well as France.
The arc honors those who fought during the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars. All the French victories and generals are scripted on the inside and outside of the Arch. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I is located underneath the arc. The Arc de Triomphe is an element of the so-called Axe historique; an historic axis of monuments from the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la Défense. From its completion in 1836 to 1938 it was the biggest arch of the world, but with the completion of the Monumento a la Revolución that arch was bigger. Nowadays, the Grand Arch (also in Paris) is the worlds biggest arch.
