The emperor Basil II.
Basil II (958-1025) was a Byzantine emperor from 960 until his death. During his reign, he conquered many territories, including the Bulgarians, who at that time dominated a large part of the Balkans; this victory earned him the nickname "Bulgarian Killer". Together with Justinian I, he is considered one of the two best reigns of the Byzantine Empire.
