Donald Duck is a fictional cartoon and comic book character created by Walt Disney in 1934. He is known and loved around the world.Donald Duck

History

Donald made his first appearance in 1934 in the Silly Symphony cartoon, The Wise Little Hen. Donald was voiced by Clarence Nash. The cartoon was adapted to a newspaper comic strip which was published the same year.

Personality

Donald is a white barnyard duck who usually wears a sailor suit and cap. He is known—in both cartoons and comics—for his explosive temper.  His greatest sources of frustration are two mischievous chipmunks named Chip and Dale. These two rob his pantry and nest in his roof. Donald's temper usually backfires, leaving him either injured, humiliated, or embarrassed.

Carl Barks

Donald's universe was greatly expanded when Carl Barks began writing and drawing the Donald Duck comic books and stories in the 1940s. The first Barks-drawn comic book was Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold in 1942.
Barks' creations include Donald's Uncle Scrooge McDuck, a stingy, grumpy billionaire, Gyro Gearloose, an absent-minded amateur inventor, and Gladstone Gander, a suave, well-dressed gander afflicted with eternal good luck.
Donald lives in Duckberg, Calisota, with his three little nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie. His girlfriend is Daisy Duck. His comic book stories are either domestic comedies set at home in Duckberg or treasure hunts to exotic lands led by Uncle Scrooge.
