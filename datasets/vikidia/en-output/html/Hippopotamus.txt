Hippopotamus
The hippopotamus (scientific name : Hippopotamus amphibius) is a plant-eating African mammal. Its name is Greek and means "horse of the river".  Hippopotamuses live in groups of up to 30 animals, and are led by a single powerful male. A group is called a pod, herd, dale, or bloat. They live in lakes, pools, and rivers in areas south of the Sahara desert.
