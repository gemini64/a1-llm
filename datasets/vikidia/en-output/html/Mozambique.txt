History
Before European explorers arrived, Mozambique was home to indigenous tribes who lived off the land. In the late 15th century, Portuguese explorers reached Mozambique and claimed it as a colony. For centuries, Mozambique was under Portuguese rule and influenced by their language, culture, and traditions.
In the mid-20th century, Mozambique fought for its independence from Portugal. In 1975, it finally gained freedom and became an independent nation. However, shortly after independence, Mozambique faced a long and devastating civil war that lasted for over 15 years. This war caused immense suffering and hardship for the people of Mozambique.
After the civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique focused on rebuilding and healing. The country has made significant progress in various areas, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Today, Mozambique is known for its beautiful coastline, diverse wildlife, and vibrant culture.
Despite the challenges it has faced, Mozambique continues to grow and develop. It is a country with a rich cultural heritage and a resilient population striving for a brighter future.
