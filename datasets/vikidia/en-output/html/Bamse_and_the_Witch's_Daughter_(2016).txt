Bamse And The Witch's Daughter (Swedish:Bamse och HÃ¤xans Dotter) is a 2016 Swedish animated feature film directed by Johan Kindblom after an original script by Jon Nohrstedt, using Tomas Tivemark's already well-established characters. It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 2016, Bamse And The Thunder Bell (2018 film). This is the first time since before 2016 where a Bamse production features voice acting by others than only Christian Ryltenius himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well.
