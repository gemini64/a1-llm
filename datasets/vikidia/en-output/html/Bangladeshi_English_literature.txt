History
A long time ago, during the British rule, some Bangladeshi writers started writing in English. This helped them share their stories with more people around the world. One of the earliest writers was Begum Rokeya, who wrote a famous story called Sultana’s Dream in 1905. It’s about a world where women are in charge. (*)
