Krishnachandra Roy
Krishnachandra Roy (1810-182) was the king of Nadia. His role in the history of Bengali literature, Bengali culture and Bengali Hindu society is unforgettable. Nadia is considered as the best man of the royal family. He was a scholar, educated in Sanskrit and Persian, and a musician. Krishnachandra, an intensely conservative king, was the patron of the proverbial geniuses of Bengal, such as Ramprasad Sen of Shaktapadavali, Bharat Chandra Raigunakar, the author of the Annadamangal poem, and the humorous Gopal Bhar. Annadamangal Kavya was composed in his royal court. The world famous pottery of Krishnanagar was started on his initiative.
Krishnachandra Roy was a man of strategy. When Nawab Sirajuddaula clashed with the British, he sided with the British. He was captured during the reign of the next Nawab Mir Qasim. He was released due to the intervention of the English. The Company Government conferred the title of Maharaja on him for his loyalty.

Significant achievement
His achievement is the worship of Jagadhatri in Bengal and the introduction of Shaktras in Navadvipa. According to legend, Krishnachandra was imprisoned in 1754 for failing to pay taxes to Nawab Alivardi Khan of Bengal. The time was near Durgotsab. When the fort festival was almost over when he was finally released from the Nawab's prison, on his way back to Krishnanagar, the king realized that it was Vijaya Dashami. The king fell asleep in the boat and there he saw in a dream that a purple quadrilateral virgin goddess was telling him to worship her on the Shuklanabami date of the next month of Kartik. As a result, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced. The following year, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced in Chandannagar by his friend Indranarayan Chowdhury. Also, Maharaja Krishnachandra initiated the worship of the idol of Malopara Baroari Jagadhatri (Mother Jaleshwari).
