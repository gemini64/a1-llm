Light is a form of energy that is visible to the human eye.  It travels at a constant speed, represented by the letter c.  The distance that light travels in a year is called a light year.
The color of light is determined by its frequency, or wavelength.  White light is a combination of multiple colors.
Light can also be thought to exist as discrete particles, called photons.  These are too small to observe directly.
