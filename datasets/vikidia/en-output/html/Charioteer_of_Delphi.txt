Charioteer of Delphi
The Charioteer of Delphi is an Ancient Greek bronze sculpture. It is considered one of the finest sculptures from antiquity. The statue is life-sized. It stands 1.8 m and dates to 478 or 474 BC. It was discovered in 1896 at the Sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi. It is now in the Delphi Archaeological Museum.
The statue was probably a part of a larger group of statues. These statues probably included the chariot, four (possibly six) horses, and two grooms. When intact, it must have been one of the most imposing works of statuary in the world. It was the gift of a Sicilian tyrant who won a chariot race at Delphi.
