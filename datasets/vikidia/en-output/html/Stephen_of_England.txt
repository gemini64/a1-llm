Stephen (c.1097-1054) was king of England and Duke of Normandy (1135-1154). Also known as Stephen of Blois.
He was grandson of William the Conqueror. He seized the throne from his cousin Matilda (daughter and heir of king Henry I), after Henry's death.
Civil war was followed until Matilda was defeated and forced to leave England in 1148. Henry II, son of Matilda, succeeded to him.
