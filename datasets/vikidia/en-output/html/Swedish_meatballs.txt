Swedish meatballs served with mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, and pickled cucumber
Swedish meatballs are a dish made popular in the United States by Swedish immigrants to the Midwest in the 19th century. In Sweden, the dish is associated with Christmas. In the US there are many variants. The meatballs are made with ground beef or a combination of ground beef, pork, and sometimes veal. Seasonings include white pepper, or allspice and salt. They are served with gravy, boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam (or cranberries in the US), and sometimes fresh pickled cucumber. The meatballs are about 1" in diameter.
