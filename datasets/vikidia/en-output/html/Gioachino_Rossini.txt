Rossini in 1865
Gioachino Rossini was an Italian opera  composer. He was born on 29 February 1792 in Pesaro, Papal States, and died 13 November 1868 from pneumonia at his country house at Passy.  In 1822, he married the opera singer Isabella Colbran. After her death, he married Olympe PÃ©lissier in 1846.
Rossini wrote 39 operas, as well as sacred music, chamber music, songs, and some instrumental and piano pieces. In 1829, he retired from composition. His works include The Barber of Seville, Cinderella, Moses and Pharoah, Semiramide, and William Tell.
In 1822, Rossini met Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven was 51, deaf, cantankerous, and in failing health. Beethoven wrote in his conversation notebook: "Ah, Rossini. So you're the composer of The Barber of Seville. I congratulate you. It will be played as long as Italian opera exists. Never try to write anything else but opera buffa; any other style would do violence to your nature."
