The Airbus A300 was the world's first twin-engined wide-body airliner and also the first aircraft produced by Airbus, marking a significant milestone in commercial aviation. It was developed in the early 1970s and made its first flight on October 28, 1972. A300 had a range of about 2,700 to 3,000 nautical miles (5,000â€“5,600 km), which made it suitable for medium- to long-haul routes. The aircraft typically seated from 266 to 300 passengers but a maximum capacity around 360 passengers.
