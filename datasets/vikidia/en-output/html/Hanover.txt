History
Hannover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Hannover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. Its position on the upper navigable river helped it to grow by increasing trade. In the 14th century the main churches of Hannover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates.
