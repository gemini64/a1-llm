On the pH scale, a base is a chemical with a pH higher than 7. Examples of common bases at home are soap, baking soda and some cleaning products.
Bases form negatively charged hydroxide ions in water, while acids form positively charged hydrogen ions in water. When these hydroxide ions and hydrogen ions come into contact with eachother, they react and form water. This process is called neutralization.
When normal pH paper is dipped into a base dissolved in water, it turns blue.
