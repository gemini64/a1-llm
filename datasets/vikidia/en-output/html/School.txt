A school is a place where children learn with help of teachers.
In many countries, children have to go to school for at least 10 years or more (e.g. from 6 to 16 years old) and additional possibilities often exist for younger old and older children. When the children have acquired a certain level of knowledge, they may get a certificate that allows them to pursue further studies or learning a specific profession.
There are many different school systems, usually organized at the level of countries (e.g. in France) or states (e.g. in Germany). Some international systems also exist, such as the European schools.
