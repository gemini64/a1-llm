Baking soda is a chemical compound with the chemical formula NaHCO3. It is also known as bicarbonate of soda.  It is a powder used in cooking, primarily for baked goods such as scones (biscuits), and as a leavening (raising) agent for some types of cakes.  It can also be used in small quantities for adults as a digestive medicine which, when mixed with water, can be drunk to relieve a sore stomach, wind, and indigestion.
It is also used in experiments, such as demonstrating a volcanic eruption; in this experiment, baking soda reacts with vinegar in a model volcano.  When this happens, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is released, causing the contents to burst out through the top of the model, simulating an eruption.
