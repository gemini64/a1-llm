A mountain man was an explorer, trailblazer, and animal trapper in western North America. The population of mountain men flourished between 1810 and 1880, and peaked in 1840. They were well known throughout the Rocky Mountains region.
Mountain men began disappearing in the 1840s. Tastes in fashion changed. Men wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats. Additionally, the mountain men had nearly made the beaver extinct in North America. Famous mountain men include Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, and Jedediah Smith.
