Campaign in the Galba Empire

When proclaimed in 68, Galba appointed him to command the legions of Germany. He was in a bad financial situation, and left Rome leaving his wife Galeria Fundana and their children in lodgings; some creditors wanted to prevent him from leaving Rome and he had to roll up his sleeves to be able to leave (when he was emperor he took revenge on these creditors).
