A Bactrian camel.
A dromedary camel.
A camel is a large mammal, with on or two humps on its back: the Bactrian camel, native of central Asia, has two humps, while the dromedary, that lives in North Africa and Arabia, has only one.
Camels are well adapted desert animals, which don't necessary mean that they like hot places : the Bactrian camel is native of steppes of Siberia and Mongolia, it can be found in the cold desert of Gobi. Dromedarius lives in the hot desert of Arabia, and in the Sahara. It has also been introduced to Australia.
Camels have been domesticated ages ago. They are bred as mounts, and also for their milk.
