While Stanley Lieber or “Stan Lee” that he’s more known as would work on multiple different comics over the years he is most known for working at Marvel and the cameos he used to bring into every marvel movie (and more) from 1989’s The Trail of the Incredible Hulk to 2019’s Avengers: Endgame before his death. While Stan is gone the characters he has created will live on forever. Especially the heroes he has (co-)created over the years.
