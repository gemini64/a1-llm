The Great Gatsby is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald published by Scribner's in 1925. The story is based on Fitzgerald's experiences on the plush estates of Long Island during the Roaring Twenties. It tells of a bootleg millionaire with shady connections named Jay Gatsby. The story explores his passion for beautiful, flippant, but married, debutante and flapper Daisy Buchanan. His passion becomes an obsession. George Wilson, a garage mechanic, suspects Gatsby of being his wife Myrtle's lover. Wilson shoots Gatsby to death.
The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess during the Roaring Twenties. It is thought a cautionary tale about the American Dream. The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day.
The book sold poorly, disappointing Fitzgerald greatly, but in succeeding years, it became not only Fitzgerald's most popular book, but a novel consistently read and studied in high school and college classrooms. With Moby Dick, The Scarlet Letter, and The Grapes of Wrath, The Great Gatsby is considered by some to be the Great American Novel.
