Wiimmfi logo
Wiimmfi is a custom server that replaces Nintendo Wii servers which were shut down in 2014. The service has full support for 380 games, works with some issues or is partially working on 22 games, and 671 games currently in testing. While Nintendo terminated Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in 2014, those who enjoyed playing games like Mario Kart Wii online have made ways to continue doing so. One particularly easy method is provided by Wiimmfi, a community-created replacement for Nintendo WFC. The servers were created by Chadderz and MrBean35000vr. Wii U and 3DS are provided by Pretendo servers after the servers were shut down in 2024.
