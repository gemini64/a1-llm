A musician who plays the guitar
A musician is a person who practices music as a professional or amateur. Typically, a musician practices one or more instruments, although people like singers do not use musical instruments as an object, but their voice.
Either the musician composes the music (composer), or he interprets it by performing it (singer or instrumentalist) or by directing it (conductor or choir director).
A musician learns music either with music theory and takes lessons, or he is self-taught.

Group of musicians
In an orchestra, the musicians who play the same part are called the music stand.
A musician can play in musical groups (jazz, rock, chamber music, modern music, private groups) or in orchestras (symphony orchestra, philharmonic orchestra, concert band) or alone.
