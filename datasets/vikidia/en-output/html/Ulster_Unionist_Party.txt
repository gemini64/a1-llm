The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is a political party in Northern Ireland, which is in favor of the British identity. Historically, the UUP was the main opponent of the Sinn FÃ©in, which is in favor of the Irish identity. Now, the Democratic Unionist Party has overgrown the UUP.
The UUP is against the European Union, but in a much softer way than the DUP. The party does have some conservative opinions towards social rights.
