Madeira is an archipelago, which is a part of Portugal. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of the coast of Morocco and north of the Canary Islands. Alongside the Azores, Madeira is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal. The capital of the archipelago is Funchal.

It is noted for its nature, good climate, historical and cultural value and above all the Madeira wine. In the 80s, the islands were a special economic zone to boost the local economy.
