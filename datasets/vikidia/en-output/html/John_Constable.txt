Constable's self-portrrait, about 1806
John Constable (11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English Romantic painter. He is known mostly for his landscape paintings of the area surrounding his home called Dedham Vale —now known as "Constable Country". Constable was not financially successful in his lifetime, but his pictures today bring enormous sums. He was elected to the Royal Academy at age 52. His paintings were more appreciated in France during his lifetime than in his native land, and inspired the Barbizon School of Art. His most famous paintings include Dedham Vale (1802) and The Hay Wain (1821).
