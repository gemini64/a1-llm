Gluttony means eating or drinking to much, especially to the point of waste.
Gluttony comes from the Latin word gula, which is derived from gluttire which means "to gulp down or swallow".
In Christianity, gluttony is considered a sin and is considered one of the Seven deadly sins in some Christian denominations.
