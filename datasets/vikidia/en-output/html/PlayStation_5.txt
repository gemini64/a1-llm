PlayStation 5
The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a ninth generation video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was announced as the successor to the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, and was released worldwide one week later. The PS5 offers a substantial upgrade in nearly every way over the standard PlayStation 4, which is now over 11 years old. The quality of PS5 games, full support for 4K media, faster loading times, and extra features like haptic feedback make the PS5 more than worth the upgrade for current PS4 owners. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) today(when?) announced the PlayStation 5 console (PS5) has surpassed 50 million units sold through to consumers, three years since its Nov. 2020 launch. The console also contains a PlayStation Store for users to buy and download games easier than ever before like its predecessor the (PS4).  The price for a standard Slim console costs $499.99, the Digital Edition console costs $449.99. In 2024, the PS5 is a much more accessible and attractive proposition than at launch. Improved availability, a growing game library, and its impressive hardware make it a compelling choice for console gamers. Hundreds of games are available on the console including: Astro's Playroom, Final Fantasy 16, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2 are excellent, genuine PS5 exclusives that truly shine on the PlayStation 5. However, it's worth remembering that, in the year 2024, the term 'exclusive' is a bit more fluid than how it was used before.
