The PlayStation Store was launched by Sony on November 11, 2006 for the PlayStation 3. The store contains the largest library of PlayStation games in the world. Explore the PlayStation Store from your console, smartphone or web browser and discover a treasure trove of games — from triple-A blockbusters to indie gems — as well as add-ons and season passes.

PlayStation 3
PlayStation Store was launched within the PlayStation 3 on November 11, 2006. There are four different versions of the store on the platform: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan and North America (including South America).

PlayStation Portable
PlayStation Store was supported on PlayStation Portable starting by October 2008 with 5.00 firmware update. The native PlayStation Store front on PSP was closed on March 31, 2016, while in-app purchases remained available after the store closed. PS Store functionality on PSP was fully closed on July 2, 2021, except for the purchased items list which still allows to download previously purchased content or PSP content purchased from the PS3.

PlayStation Vita
PlayStation Store was launched on the PlayStation Vita on December 17, 2011, and is accessible via an icon on the LiveArea. As of December 2016, all Vita games were also made available to be downloaded digitally on the PlayStation Network via the storefront, although not all games are released physically. There are four different versions of the PlayStation Store: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan and North America. There is no Vita's PlayStation Store localization in China and South America.

PlayStation 4
PlayStation 4 version of the PlayStation Store was released on November 15, 2013, along with the console in North America, and on November 29 in most of Europe with the console two weeks following the North American launch. The PS4 version of the PS Store uses the same overall design and interface to its predecessor, the PlayStation 3's storefront; however, the color scheme has been altered to match that of the console's theme, changing from black to blue.

In January 2013, the PlayStation Store was made available via Internet browser. Users can purchase content for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable via the online store, then download it (or put it in a download queue) via their respective devices. In October 2015, a "Wishlist" option was added. On October 15, 2020, in anticipation of the launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony announced that users would no longer be able to browse, purchase and download PS3, PSP and PS Vita content, and PS4 avatars, themes and applications via the desktop and mobile versions of the PlayStation Store.
