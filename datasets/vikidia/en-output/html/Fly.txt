Photography of a flesh fly.
A fly is an insect in the order of diptera (that means the fly has two wings).

Types
There are two types of flies: the flesh fly eats meat. The meat it eats can be in way of decaying. The other type of flies is feeding of excrements. Both species also like cheese; the cheese is a place of laying for the fly, that's why humans have to protect their aliments to avoid to see asticots, fly's larva, in their foods.
