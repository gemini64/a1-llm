Roman numerals were numerals used in Ancient Rome.
The current year (2024) in Roman numerals is MMXXIV.

Ⅽ = 100
Ⅾ = 500
Ⅿ = 1000



Zero
Roman numerals have no zero, as the Romans lacked a number for the number zero. However the word nulla (meaning "none") was used to represent 0. The letter N was sometimes used for 0 in the Middle Ages to modern times.

Large numbers
The Romans had to main ways of writing large numbers, the apostrophus and the vinculum.

Apostrophus
Using the apostrophus method, 500 is written as IↃ, while 1,000 is written as CIↃ. This system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (image the Cs and Ↄs as parentheses) had its origins in Etruscan numbers.
Each additional set of C and Ↄ surrounding CIↃ raises the value by a factor of 10.
Examples:

IↃ = 500
CIↃ = 1,000
IↃↃ = 5,000
CCIↃↃ = 10,000
IↃↃↃ = 50,000
CCCIↃↃↃ = 100,000


Sometimes the numbers were simplified:

CIↃ (1,000) → ↀ
IↃↃ (5,000) → ↁ
CCIↃↃ (10,000) → ↂ
IↃↃↃ (50,000) → ↇ
CCCIↃↃↃ (100,000) → ↈ



Vinculum
Using the vinculum, Roman numerals were multiplied by 1,000 by adding a "bar" or "overline", for example:

Ⅳ = 4,000
ⅩⅩⅤ = 25,000


In an extension of the vinculum, a three-sided box is used to multiply by 100,000.
Vinculum notation is not the same as the custom of adding an overline to a numeral simply to show it is a number.
