A merchant on the road home after a long journey, rests in a mysterious castle. He plucks a rose in the castle garden. The castle belongs to a hideous Beast who orders the merchant to bring his daughter Beauty to the castle as payment for the rose.
At home, the merchant prepares Beauty for the long journey to the Beast's castle. This parting is a great sacrifice for both father and daughter because they love each other dearly. Once settled in the castle, Beauty and the Beast become friends, and then fall in love.

The Beast reprimands her for forgetting his one requirement. She begs his forgiveness. The Beast asks her if she loves him. She says she does, and, at that instant, the Beast becomes a handsome prince. They marry and live happily ever after.
