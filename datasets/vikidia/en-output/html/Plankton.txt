Different plankton species.
Plankton are aquatic organisms that drift in the water and let themselves be carried along by the currents.

Types of plankton
There are several types of plankton. Here are the two best known:

Zooplankton are animal plankton. They can be carnivorous or herbivorous and eat other plankton. They include, among other things, jellyfish, some crustaceans such as krill and some fish larvae or eggs.
Phytoplankton are plant plankton. They contain certain algae, for example, and use sunlight to create their own energy (this is called photosynthesis), like land plants.



Ecological importance
The basking shark may look frightening with its huge mouth, but it only eats tiny animals such as zooplankton.
Plankton forms the base of food chains in aquatic environments. Many small fish, seabirds and turtles feed on it. Some of the biggest animals of our time, such as the blue whale and the whale shark, eat almost nothing else.
Thanks to photosynthesis, phytoplankton produces more than half of the oxygen we breathe, compared with less than 20% for the Amazon rainforest, considered to be the Earth's green lung! It also absorbs a significant proportion of the carbon dioxide in the air.
