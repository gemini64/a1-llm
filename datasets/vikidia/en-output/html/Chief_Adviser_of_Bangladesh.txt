The Chief Adviser of Bangladesh is the head of the interim government, tasked with overseeing the transition between elected governments. (*)  This role is crucial during periods of political instability or when regular elections cannot be held. (*)

History
The position of Chief Adviser was first established in 1991 through the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. This system was introduced to ensure free and fair elections following the end of military rule under Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The Chief Adviser is typically a politically neutral figure, often a retired Chief Justice, appointed to lead the caretaker government.

Recent Developments
In 2024, Muhammad Yunus was appointed as the Chief Adviser after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country amid a student-led uprising. (*)  Yunus’s appointment marked a significant moment in Bangladesh’s political history, emphasizing the need for neutral leadership during times of crisis. (*)
