Snowshoe hare during summer
Snowshoe hare during winter
The Snowshoe hare (scientific name : Lepus americanus) is a hare. It lives in North America as far as Alaska. Snowshoe hares are well adapted to snow. They have large feet, which allow them to walk on snow. The snowshoe hare is sometimes called the snowshoe rabbit, but it is a real hare, and not a rabbit.
Its fur changes with the season: brown in summer, it turns white in winter to camouflage itself in the snow. It is very similar to the Arctic hare, which lives in Arctic regions, and the Mountain hare, which lives in the mountains.
