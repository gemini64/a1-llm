Domenico Scarlatti, 1738 portrait by Domingo Antonio Velasco
Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (Naples, 26 October 1685 â€“ Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer. He spent most of his life in Spain or Portugal in service to the royal families. He is most famous for the 555 keyboard sonatas he composed. These sonatas show the influence of Spanish music, particularly of Spanish dance rhythms and the percussive effects of guitars, castanets and tambourines.
