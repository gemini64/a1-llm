A Bell is a simple musical instrument, made of metal, which makes sounds when it is hit (with a clapper or a ball inside it). This type of instrument is called a percussion instrument.  Bells are used in lots of different ways, like calling people to church when there is a service, or for waking people up on an alarm clock.
They can also be used to warn people of danger (think of a Fire alarm), or for attracting a person's attention in a hotel or at a shop counter. Bells are also associated with Santa Claus, as a special type of bell known as a Sleigh bell is said to be part of the dressing of his Sleigh, and worn on the collar of his Reindeers.
