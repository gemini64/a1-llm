Dementia is a collective name for all kinds of complaints and symptoms. In people with dementia, the brain does not work properly, so that information no longer ends up properly. The brains of people with dementia deteriorate. This affects the behavior and mood of the individuals. Their daily lives are also disrupted. Someone with dementia is called a demented person and having dementia is called dementia.
There are a total of 50 types of dementia. These include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and Korsakov's syndrome. While people with dementia can be forgetful, forgetfulness is different from dementia
In dementia, the nerve cells break down. Sometimes the nerve cells themselves do not break down, but the connections between them no longer work properly. This decrease causes the brain to work less well. In some patients, the decline is much faster than in others. As a result, one person can live independently for a long time and the other cannot. Eventually, the patient becomes so weakened by the dementia that it dies from the disease. An infection can also arise from pneumonia, because the patient can no longer swallow.
