Cannabis (scientific name: Cannabis sativa), also known as weed, ganja, marijuana and grass, is a crude drug which is smoked to alter the mood of people who use it. Sometimes it calms them down, sometimes it makes them more active.  In some countries, like the United Kingdom, the possession of Cannabis for smoking or sale is illegal.  In other countries, like the United States, it is legal to possess and use Cannabis for medical purposes (usually pain relief) in people who are seriously ill with things like epilepsy or cancer.  Possession of it without a prescription is still illegal.
