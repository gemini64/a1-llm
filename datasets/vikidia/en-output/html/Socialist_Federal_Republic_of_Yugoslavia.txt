Flag of Yugoslavia (1946-1992)
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a former European country, created in 1919, after the First World War and collapsed at the end on the 20th century, around the year 1990. Its capital was Belgrade.

History
The country was created in 1919 with the treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the Serbians having won over the Austro-Hungarians. Very quickly, the religious diversity of the country (Catholics, Muslims, orthodoxs...) was a problem, and the extremist movement "oustachi" wanted to dislocate the country and made more and more problems. On the 9th October 1934 Vlado ÄŒernozemski assassinates Alexander the 1st, king of Yugoslavia with French minister Louis Barthou who was accompanying him in Marseille.
In 1945, the country becomes communist. But it didn't want to side with the Soviet Union, neither did it want to side with the USA. So it remained neutral, it was one of the countries who die not participate to the Cold War.
In the 90s, with the fall of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia fell into civil war and collapsed. Seven new states become independent:

Bosnia-Herzegovina
Croatia
Kosovo (non-recognized country)
Macedonia
Montenegro
Serbia
Slovenia
