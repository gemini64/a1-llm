Sovereign Movement

The sovereignism of the Quebec people aims to make Quebec a sovereign state, independent of the Canadian confederation. The Quebecer sovereignism claims to express the will of the Quebecer people that it is recognized as an independent country, first by its own citizens, then by the Canadian confederation and, finally, by the rest of the world.
Its motives are coming from the fact that Quebec is the only territory with a francophone majority in North America and it indicates a unique important culture. Given its economic strength ( among the 20 leading in the world according to the latest estimations) the sovereignists of Quebec believe that Quebec deservse to speak and act for itself on the international stage.

History

The Europeans arrived on the territory of Quebec in the XVth century. It was already inhabited by thousands of years by the Amerindians who were maybe remote descendants of people come from Asia. In his arrival in 1534, the explorer Jacques Cartier gained ownership of the territory in the name of France.
The city of Quebec was founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1608, and the city of Montreal was founded in 1642 by Maisonneuve.
But many British also wanted to own land of the territory of Quebec. So there have been many wars and battles between the French and the British for the leadership. Finally the British took it in 1759. One of the most memorable battles took place on the Plains of Abraham, on September 13, 1759, two general opposing: Montcalm for the French and Wolf for the British. Both died after the battle: even today, one can see a monument in their memory on the Plains of Abraham This battle marked the start of the English Conquest and the end of French regime.
