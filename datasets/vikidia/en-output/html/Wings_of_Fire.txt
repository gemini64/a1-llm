Story
The story is about dragons which are divided into 7 Clans, who are at war.
In the book, it is said that Queen Oasis, a SandWing, had three daughters, who have been fighting for the throne since their mother died: Burn, the eldest who is very violent, Blister, the cleverest one, and finally Blaze, the youngest who doesnâ€™t care about anything but her appearance. All three think only of power and its privileges.
Later in the story, we discover the "Dragonet Prophecy": seven dragons will hatch during the Clearest Night, a MudWing, a SeaWing, a SkyWing, a NightWing and a SandWing.
Unfortunately, the SkyWing egg will be killed by Burn, who cursed the Prophecy: she wanted to do everything to prevent it from happening.
