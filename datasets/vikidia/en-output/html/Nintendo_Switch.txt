Nintendo Switch
Pro controller. You don’t have to be a pro at games to use the controller.
The Nintendo Switch is a video game console that came out in 2017. It usually has red and blue sides. But can have yellow and blue or just white. It’s the next console after the Wii U. There are 2 sticks and 8 game buttons and a button to take pictures or go to the Home Screen. Its sales total, as of December 31, 2023, now sits at 139.36 million, 14.66 million units shy of Nintendo's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS. According to Nintendo, over 1.2 billion software units have been sold for Switch – the most for any Nintendo console. And with hundreds of great games — including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate — it's one of our favorite consoles of this generation. Nintendo Switch supports multiplayer gaming options of all kinds. You can play together online or in the same room using one system or multiple systems*. Specific features vary by game, such as voice chat or split-screen play, but sharing fun with friends and family is a key focus for Nintendo Switch.
