The 2020s is the current decade that began on 1 January 2020 and will end on 31 December 2029.
The 2020s began with the COVID-19 pandemic, though the virus had appeared in December 2019. The pandemic led to a global economic recession, global inflation having a sustained rise for the first time since the 1970s, and a global supply chain crisis.
On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October which led to a war between Israel and Hamas.
