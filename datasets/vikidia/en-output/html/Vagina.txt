Anatomy of the Female reproductive organs.
The Vagina is a sex organ which exists in many female animals and people.
Women use their vagina and their clitoris when making love to satisfy their sexual desires.  In a heterosexual relationship, the man puts his penis in the vagina to stimulate himself and give his partner pleasure.
This is where babies come out in mammals during birth (childbirth in humans). During childbirth, the vagina dilates (gets wider) by about 20 centimetres, to allow the baby to pass through.
It should not be confused with the urethra.  A woman has two holes in their pelvis:  the urethra is for urination and the vagina is for making love and giving birth.
This is also where blood comes out from when a woman is menstruating (also known as a period.)
