Cartilage is a tissue in the body. It is a tough yet flexible tissue that connects bones at the joints.
Cartilage is made of collagens; proteoglycans; and non-collagenous proteins. The rest of the cartilage is made of a gel-like substance called ‘matrix’ that gives it its form and function.
Cartilage contains over 65% - 80% water. The older one gets the less water is in their cartilage decreasing their range of motion.
