They have long necks, 4 stumpy legs, long tails to counterbalance the long necks, small heads and small brains, nostrils high up on the skull and blunt teeth. Some sauropods have body armour to protect itself from other dinosaurs.
They are found on all the continents except Antarctica. They lived in places with a lot of water and trees.
