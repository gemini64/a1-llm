Symbol of Bangladeshi taka
The Bangladeshi Taka (৳) is the official currency of Bangladesh. It is abbreviated as BDT. The Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, issued and regulated the Taka. The currency is used in all financial transactions within Bangladesh, and its symbol is derived from the Bengali script for the word "Taka."

Key features of the Bangladeshi Taka include:


Denominations: The Taka is subdivided into 100 poisha. However, due to inflation and the decreasing value of poisha, it is becoming less common in everyday transactions.
Banknotes and Coins: The currency is available in various denominations of banknotes and coins. Commonly used banknotes include ৳1, ৳2, ৳5, ৳10, ৳20, ৳50, ৳100, ৳500, and ৳1000. Coins are also available in smaller denominations.
Security Features: To prevent counterfeiting, Bangladeshi banknotes incorporate several security features, such as watermarks, holographic strips, and security threads.
Design and Symbolism: The design of Bangladeshi currency often features images that reflect the country's rich cultural heritage, historical landmarks, and prominent figures. The national emblem, the Shaheed Minar (Martyrs' Monument), and the images of notable personalities can be found on various banknotes.



Exchange Rate: The exchange rate of the Bangladeshi Taka against other currencies fluctuates based on economic factors, trade balances, and global market conditions. The Bangladesh Bank actively manages the exchange rate to ensure stability.
International Trade: While the Taka is primarily used within Bangladesh, it may also be accepted in some border regions of neighbouring countries. However, foreign currencies such as the US Dollar or Euro are more commonly used for international trade and transactions.



Inflation: Like many other countries, Bangladesh has experienced inflation over the years, impacting the value of its currency—the Bangladesh Bank endeavours to implement monetary policies that aim to control inflation and stabilize the Taka.
Remittances: Bangladesh receives significant remittances from its citizens working abroad. These remittances play a crucial role in the country's economy and contribute to the stability of the Taka.
