A meatball is a food made of ground (British English: minced) meat shaped into a ball and usually cooked, though occasionally it is served raw. The typical meat is beef, pork, turkey, or a mixture of these.
It appears in a popular dish, spaghetti and meatballs, which in Italian cuisine and America is served in a tomato sauce.
