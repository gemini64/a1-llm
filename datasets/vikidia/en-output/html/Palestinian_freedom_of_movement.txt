The restriction of Palestinian movement in the occupied territories by Israel is a major issue that demands attention in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is important to note that, after the 1967 war, the territories were declared a closed military zone, and in 1993, complete blockades were implemented due to rising political violence. Despite general evacuation orders being issued in 1972, allowing residents to move freely, personal exit permits were required after the first intifada.
