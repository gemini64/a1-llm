Boston baked beans
Boston baked beans is an American bean dish sweetened and flavored with molasses or maple syrup. A variety of beans may be used and the dish often includes bacon or salt pork.
The Pilgrims of 1620 learned the dish from Native Americans. In colonial America, baked beans were prepared on Saturday and left in the oven for Sunday consumption.
