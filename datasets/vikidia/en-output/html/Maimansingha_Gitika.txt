The Maimansingha Gitika is a collection of ten Palagan songs popular in the East Mymensingh region, now known as Netrakona. The first volume has ten verses written by different authors, but Chandrakumar Dey collected it. These songs were passed down orally for generations but were collected and published by Dr. Dinesh Chandra Sen with the help of others between 1923-32 at Calcutta University. Chandrakumar Dey, who lived in Aithor in the Netrakona sub-division of Mymensingh district, collected these stories at that time. Interestingly, this hymn has been translated into 23 different languages and printed worldwide.
