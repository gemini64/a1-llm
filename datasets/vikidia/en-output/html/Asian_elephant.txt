Description

Elephant in the Nyíregyháza Zoo
Asian elephants are different from African elephants. They are smaller, have smaller ears, a more rounded back, and a fourth toenail on each of their back feet. They have thick, dry skin with a small amount of stiff hair, and are grey to brown in color. Female Asian elephants have small tusks and occasionally none at all. Sometimes pink spots appear on the ears as a result of loss of pigment (depigmentation).

Most of the populations occur on some of the Andaman Islands (India). They live in a variety of habitats including dry places and moist humid jungles.

Social lives

Elephant mother and baby
Asian elephants live in groups of 5-18 individuals. Groups may merge with other groups to form clans and herds. The group is led by the oldest and most experienced female in the group. She is called the matriarch.
When a male elephant is mature, the females force him out of the herd. Mature males live alone or in bachelor groups. These males only mix with the females to mate. It takes up to 660 days or 22 months until the babies are born.

Food
The Asian elephant is a vegetarian. It eats mostly grass, hay, twigs, bark and fruits. It can live up to 60 to 80 years. It can weigh up to 5000kg and be up to 300cm tall.
