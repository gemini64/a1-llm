A plural is a form of a noun in which there is more than one of that noun or zero.
Plural nouns usually have an "s" at the end of them, so one house and two houses. Except in these cases:

Nouns ending in "s", "x", "z", "ch", or "sh", have "es" added to end. For example "church" becomes "churches".
A noun ending in "y" which is preceded by a consonant (any letter that is not a vowel ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u") has the "y" changed into "ies". For example, baby becomes babies.
If a noun ends in "f" or "fe", it is replaced with "ves". For example, half becomes halves.
