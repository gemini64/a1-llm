Frederick III in 1875
Frederick III or Friedrich III (18 October 1831 â€“ 15 June 1888) was a German Emperor and King of Prussia from March 1888 until his death in June 1888. He was the only son of Wilhelm I.
Frederick married Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. They shared liberal views and wanted commoners to have more say in the government. Starting in April 1888, Frederick's health deteriorated significantly. He became too weak to walk and spent most of his time in bed. He had a persistent cough that produced a lot of pus. In early June, the cancer had spread to his esophagus, making it impossible for him to eat.
Frederick III passed away in Potsdam at 11:30 a.m. on 15 June, and his 29-year-old son Wilhelm II succeeded him.
