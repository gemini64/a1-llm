The country was for the arrival of the Spaniards inhabited by Mayans. In the 17th century, the area was colonized by British timber traders and pirates.
It was as a British-Honduras formally a British colony in 1840, even though it was claimed made by Mexico and Guatemala. Hurricane Hattie in 1961 brought a lot of damage in Belize. The Government decided that having a capital below sea level was too risky. After a few years was the new capital city Belmopan, designed in the exact geographical center of the country. In the 1970s, with the move of government buildings started.
In 1964 British Honduras got internal self-government and Belize in June 1973 it got the name. The effective authority, however, remained in the hands of the Governor from Great Britain. The people's United Party, led by George Cadle Price, was the leader of the independence movement. On 21 September 1981, after delays because of territorial disputes with Guatemala, Belize became independent from the United Kingdom. The new State border disputes remained common. There remained even, to protect, a British garrison behind. It took until 1991 before Guatemala recognized Belize. To date, however, there is a border dispute between the two countries. On many Guatemalan cards is Belize (or part of it) as Department of Guatemala.
On 20 January 2005, unrest broke out because of tax increases.
