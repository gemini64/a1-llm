The full Mona Lisa painting
Lisa del Giocondo probably modeled for Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait. This traditional view, based on Giorgio Vasari and Antonio de Beatis, was confirmed in 2008 by the discovery of a handwritten note in an incunabula of the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg (signature D 7620 qt. INC), in which the Florentine official Agostino Vespucci reported in October 1503 about a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo by Leonardo.
