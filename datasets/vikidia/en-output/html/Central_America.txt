Central America is the land between Mexico and South America including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
Most of the economy is based on plantations or small farms growing bananas, coffee, sugar, and cotton. For their own use people grow corn and beans. The population is about 43 million. The region's total area is 200,000 square miles. Central America was ruled by the Mayan people until the Spanish conquest in the 1400s.
