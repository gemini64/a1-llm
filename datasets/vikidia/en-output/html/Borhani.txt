Borhani
Borhani is a unique digestive drink made primarily of sour yoghurt. Borhani is served at all weddings in Dhaka and Chittagong. But apart from weddings, it is served at Iftar on various social occasions and fasts. It is usually drunk to aid digestion after heavy meals like biryani and polao. Probiotic microorganisms present in it are considered to be particularly beneficial for health.

Etymology
The origin of the drink's name is unknown. However, the word probably comes from the Arabic word Burhan (Arabic: برهان), meaning "proof".
