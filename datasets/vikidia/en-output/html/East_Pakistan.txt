East Pakistan was the eastern province of Pakistan from 1947 to 1971, situated on the Bay of Bengal and geographically separated from West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) by India. Following the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, it is now known as Bangladesh. The history of East Pakistan is marked by political, linguistic, and economic disparities that ultimately led to the region's quest for independence.

Background
East Pakistan was created as a result of the partition of British India in 1947. The two geographically separated wings of Pakistan, West Pakistan and East Pakistan, shared little in terms of language, culture, and economic interests. Urdu was chosen as the official language, which marginalized the Bengali-speaking majority in East Pakistan, leading to early tensions.

Linguistic and Cultural Divide
The linguistic and cultural differences between East and West Pakistan were significant. The majority of the population in East Pakistan spoke Bengali, while Urdu was the official language. This linguistic divide became a focal point for political and cultural grievances, leading to demands for the recognition of Bengali as an official language.

Economic Disparities
The economic policies of the Pakistani government also contributed to discontent in East Pakistan. Despite its significant contribution to the economy through industries and agriculture, the region felt marginalized as resources were often directed towards the development of West Pakistan. This economic disparity fueled calls for greater autonomy.

Political Unrest
The discontent in East Pakistan took a political turn with the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, demanding autonomy for the region. The Six-Point Movement of 1966 sought more significant political and economic independence for East Pakistan. However, the government's response was to suppress these demands, further escalating tensions.

Bangladesh Liberation War
The culmination of the political, linguistic, and economic grievances was the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The military crackdown by the Pakistani government in response to demands for autonomy led to widespread atrocities, prompting the people of East Pakistan to declare independence.

Independence and Aftermath
The Bangladesh Liberation War concluded on December 16, 1971, with the surrender of Pakistani forces in Dhaka. East Pakistan emerged as the independent nation of Bangladesh, marking the end of the two-nation theory that led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947. The conflict had far-reaching geopolitical implications, reshaping the political landscape of South Asia.
Bangladesh's creation ended the economic neglect and political marginalization that East Pakistan had experienced for years. The new nation embarked on a journey of rebuilding and development, establishing itself as a sovereign state with its own distinct identity.
