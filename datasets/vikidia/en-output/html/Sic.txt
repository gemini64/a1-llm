The Latin adverb sic is inserted in a quotation to show that a typo or misspelling appeared in the original source and is being quoted.
Example:
"The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog."
This sentence should be spelled:
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
If someone was quoting the first sentence without changing the errors, they could use sic to show where the mistake has been made:
"The quick brown fox jump [sic] over the lazy dog."
