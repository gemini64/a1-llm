Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is a marriage between two members of the same sex or gender (between two woman or two man). The name gay marriage is a false term for same-sex marriage, because people in a same-sex marriage aren't always homosexual (gay). They or one of them can be bisexual, transsexual or even heterosexual.
Today, 28 countries have gay marriage. The Netherlands was the first country in 2001, followed by Belgium, Spain, Canada, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, Brazil, France, Uruguay, New Zealand, Luxembourg, the United States, Ireland, Colombia, Finland, Malta, Germany, Australia, Austria, Taiwan (not an official country) and Ecuador at last.

The member states of the European Union without same-sex marriage recognize same-sex marriages from other EU member states.
Same-sex marriage is usually described in the same law as the opposite-sex marriage (marriage between two people of the opposite gender). The old law becomes then genderneutral and marriage is described as a marriage between two people instead of between a man and a woman.

Same-sex marriages aren't a new concept. In ancient times homosexuality and other sexualities were seen as normal. For example, homosexual relationships were legal and often preformed in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.
