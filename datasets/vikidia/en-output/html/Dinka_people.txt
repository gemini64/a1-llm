The Dinka people are an ethnic group which are native to South Sudan.  There are a large population of the Dinka who live in other countries.  Their home is along the River Nile, through Bahr el Ghazal and Upper Nile (which both used to be part of Sudan when it was one country), and Abyei, inhabited by the Ngok Dinka peoples, in South Sudan.
