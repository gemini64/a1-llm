Ikhtiyār al-Dīn Muḥammad Bakhtiyār Khaljī, often called Bakhtiyar Khalji, was a famous general from Afghanistan. (*)  He lived a long time ago, around the 12th century. (*)

Early Life
Bakhtiyar Khalji was born in a place called Garmsir, which is in today’s Afghanistan. He came from a tribe known as the Khalaj. When he was young, he wanted to be a soldier and traveled to different places to find work. (*)

Big Conquests
Bakhtiyar Khalji is best known for his battles in India. Around 1203, he led his army to Bengal. He defeated the local rulers, the Sena dynasty, and captured their capital city, Nadia. This was a big deal because it started Muslim rule in Bengal. (*)
He also went to Bihar, another region in India, where he destroyed famous Buddhist universities like Nalanda and Vikramashila. This was a sad event because these places were important centers of learning. (*)

Ruling Bengal
Khalji dynasty of Bengal
After his victories, Bakhtiyar Khalji made his capital at Devkot, in what is now West Bengal. He ruled Bengal until he died in 1206. His rule helped set up the Khalji dynasty in Bengal.

Death and Legacy
In 1206, Bakhtiyar Khalji tried to invade Tibet but failed. When he returned to Bengal, he was killed by his own soldiers. Even though his rule was short, his conquests changed the history of Bengal and influenced the region for many years. (*)
