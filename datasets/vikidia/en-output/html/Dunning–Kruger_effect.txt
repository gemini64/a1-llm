The Dunning–Kruger effect is an effect in psychology where those who are stupid think they are smart and those who are smart think they are stupid. It was first described by John Kruger and David Dunning in 1999.
"Not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition. The problem with it is we see it in other people, and we don't see it in ourselves. The first rule of the Dunning–Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning–Kruger club."
