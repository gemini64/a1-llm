Southern Rhodesia was a landlocked, self-governing British Crown colony in Southern Africa established in 1923 and consisting of British South Africa Company (BSAC) territories lying south of the Zambezi River.
The British South Africa Company's administration of Rhodesia began in 1888 and the territory was chartered by Queen Victoria in 1889. In 1923, the territory was annexed and the colony of Southern Rhodesia was formed. It was abolished in 1953 when it became part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
