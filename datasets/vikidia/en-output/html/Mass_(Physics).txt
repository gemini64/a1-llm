Mass is the amount of matter contained in an object, often represented by the letter m.  It relates to the force required to move an object, the weight of an object, the molality of a solution, and other concepts in physics.  In the metric system, mass is measured in grams or kilograms.Maybe Milligrams or even Micrograms. In the imperial system we use ounces (mass), pounds and us tons.

Metric System


Micrograms
We use this for measuring food amounts and small and light weight parts.1000 ug (micrograms) is a milligram.

Milligrams
We use this for measuring stuff less than 1 gram.1000 mg (milligrams) equal to 1 gram.

Grams
We use this for measuring stuff less than 1 kilogram.28 grams is a ounce and 1000 grams is a kilogram.

Kilograms
We use this for heavier objects. Still itâ€™s equal to around 2 pounds.Not that heavy

Metric Tons/Megagrams
We use this for really big objects. Like cars,Trucks and the heavy animals.

Imperial System


Ounce
An Ounce is equal to 28 grams. It used for light stuff.

Pounds
A Pound is 16 ounces. It used for heavier items. 1 pound is not that heavy.

Ton (US)
A ton is 2000 pounds which is less than a metric ton or Megagram. A small car is about a us ton.
