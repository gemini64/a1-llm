Down syndrome is not a disease but a genetic condition; people who are affected have different physical characteristics from a most human beings.
At present the scientific data say there is one in 3,000 births.

History
In England in 1800, people were not interested in these "crazy" people.
When the cases became more frequent, however, came the first asylum for the mentally ill, the Bethlhem Royal Hospital.
Those who had these problems were brought in country places, to prevent infecting other people.
John Langdon Down was the first scholar to give an identity to the characteristics he had noticed in these people.
At the end of the studies he said they were a subspecies of the human population.

Types of Down Syndrome

Trisomy (90%)
Each cell contains an extra chromosome 21.
Translocation (6%)
There is an extra chromosome attached attached to another (usually 14).
Mosaicism (4%)
