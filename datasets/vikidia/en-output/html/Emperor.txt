An emperor is the ruler of an empire. This title is usually placed above that of king.
The word comes from the Latin imperator, which means "victorious general". The title was bestowed on Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and it referred to the Roman emperor until the reign of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who replaced it with its Greek equivalent "autocrator". A female emperor is called an empress. Napolean 3 was emperor of france to 1870-1871 by lost of the Franco-German war.  (*)
