A Lychee is a fruit that originally came from Southeast Asia and they are very sweet and they have a bit of a floral taste to them. They are very popular in Asia (areas like Japan and Korea) where they normally eat them, put them in alcohol, or make it an iced tea. Lychees look very similar to a raspberry/strawberry. It's bumpy outer skin is just a look, because the taste is very delicious, but they can have a bitter aftertaste.
