Ogrohayon, also known as Aghran, is the eighth month of the Bengali calendar and the ninth month of Shakabda. The month is also referred to as Margashirsha and known as Aghaan in spoken Bengali. The name 'Margashirsha' is derived from the star Mrigashira. While Agrahana was once the first month of the year, it is now called 'Agrahayana' as it comes before or at the beginning. It is the second month of the Hemanta season, and its dictionary means it is the time of the year when the best Brihi (paddy) is produced. In the past, this month was considered the first month of the year as a lot of paddy was made during this time.
According to Bengali Hindu society, the month of Agrahayana is particularly auspicious for marriage. The Navanna festival and Lakshmi Puja are mainly celebrated this month in West Bengal.
