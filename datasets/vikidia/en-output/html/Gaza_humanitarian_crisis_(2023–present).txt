The Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal enclave, is currently experiencing a dire humanitarian crisis. The conflict between Israel and Hamas that erupted in early October 2023 has led to a complete blockade of the area by Israel, resulting in a significant shortage of essential resources such as fuel, food, medicine, water, and medical equipment. The blockade has also led to a 90% drop in electrical availability, crippling hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, and desalination plants that provide drinking water, leading to widespread disease outbreaks throughout the region. The situation in Gaza is a matter of grave concern and requires urgent attention from the international community.
