Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to our Sun. It is only about 4.25 light-years away from the planet Earth.
The star was discovered in 1915 by Scottish astronomer Robert Innes. Its name in Latin means "near" [in the Centaur system], and is still the nearest star to be discovered. It can be seen "with the naked eye," meaning without using a magnifying instrument such as a telescope.
In 2016, a team of international astronomers discovered a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri that probably can support and may already have organic life.[Source?]

Is Will Take 22,000 Years To Spacecraft To Reach The Planet. With The Move Of Proxima Centauri, Is Will Be A Big Problem
Also, From Proxima Centauri To The Earth, Message Will Be Take 300,000 Years To Get. So We Can't Contact The Spacecraft.
