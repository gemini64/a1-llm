The Llama (scientific name : Lama glama) is a South American mammal related to the camel. It does not have a hump. The Llama is a domesticated animal used by peoples of the Andes Mountains to move goods. The Llama can move about 50-75 lbs. of goods at a time, but will refuse to move if the weight is heavier. They can tote their loads for up to 20 miles per day.
The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 m
(5.5 to 6.0 ft) tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg (280 to 450 lb). They can live 15-20 years. They are social animals and live in herds. Humans can easily teach them simples tasks.
Llamas are grazers, and eat grasses. They chew their cuds like domestic cattle. Llamas can survive by eating many different kinds of plants, and they need little water. Llamas are strong and dependable pack animals even in mountainous terrain.
Humans sometimes eat them, and their hides are used to make leather. Their wool is made into ropes, fabrics, and rugs. Their excrement is used for fuel.
