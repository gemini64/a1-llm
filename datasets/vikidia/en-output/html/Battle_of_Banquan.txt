The Battle of Banquan happened a long time ago in ancient China. It is written about in a book by Sima Qian called "Records of the Grand Historian." In this battle, two leaders fought: Huangdi, who is also known as the Yellow Emperor, and Yandi, who is called the Flame Emperor.

Background
The Battle of Banquan might really be the third of three battles. Soon after, the Yellow Emperor fought Chiyou at the Battle of Zhuolu. These battles happened close in time and place, and both involved the Yellow Emperor. Some experts think they might have been the same battle. The Battle of Banquan helped form the Yanhuang tribe, which started the Huaxia civilisation, the beginning of Chinese civilisation.
Not much is known about this battle because it happened so long ago and is mixed with myths. People say it happened around the 26th century BC.
The Shennong tribes were originally farmers from the Guanzhong Plain in the west. They spread out across the Loess Plateau and then moved east. Over time, they clashed with other tribes, like the Jiuli tribes led by Chiyou and the Youxiong tribes led by the Yellow Emperor. The last Flame Emperor, Yuwang, first fought Chiyou but lost and had to retreat. Then, he ended up fighting the Yellow Emperor, who raised armies against Shennong.
The Yellow Emperor's armies, with symbols of black bears, brown bears, pixiu (a mythical creature), and tigers, fought Shennong's armies at Banquan in the first big battle in Chinese history. After three big fights, the Flame Emperor lost and gave up his leadership to the Yellow Emperor. The Youxiong and Shennong tribes then joined forces, creating the Yanhuang tribes and including smaller tribes around them.
The growing Yanhuang tribe soon made Chiyou jealous, and he attacked Shennong's land again. The Yanhuang tribe fought back at the Battle of Zhuolu and won. This victory allowed them to expand east and start what is known as the Huaxia civilisation, the beginning of the Han Chinese civilisation. Even today, Chinese people call themselves "the Descendants of Yan and Huang."
