The Alaska Purchase happened on March 30, 1867. The United States had purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire. It was sold because Russia needed money, as they had recently lost the Crimean War to Britain and feared that it would be difficult to defend in a future war. Ironically, they first offered to sell it to Britain, but they refused, saying that maintaining Alaska would be too costly. It was instead sold to the US for $7.2 Million, which today would be nearly $122.6 Million
