Ram Mandir
Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple is a Hindu temple located in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of Rama, one of the principal deities of Hinduism.
The Babri Masjid was constructed in the 16th century AD by demolishing a pre-existing non-Islamic structure. In 1949 AD, the idols of Rama and Sita were installed in the mosque. The mosque was attacked and destroyed in 1992 AD. In 2019 AD, the Supreme Court of India ruled on the dispute. According to the judgment, the land belonged to Hindus for constructing temples, while Muslims were directed to give land elsewhere for building mosques. The court based its decision on a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which revealed the existence of a non-Islamic structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid. However, critics have widely disputed the claims of the Indian Archeology Survey as contradictory, dubious, and the result of nationalist manipulation.
On 5th August 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed Bhumi Pujan to mark the beginning of the construction of the Ram Temple. Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra is responsible for overseeing the temple's building, which is currently underway. The temple complex will include temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu, and Brahma. The inauguration of the temple is scheduled for 22nd January 2024 AD.
The temple has given rise to several controversies due to misuse of donations, delegitimization of key movement activists, and politicization of the temple by the BJP.
