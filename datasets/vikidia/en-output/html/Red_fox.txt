The Red fox (scientific name : Vulpes vulpes) is the most commonly known fox. When someone says fox, you will most likely think of the Red fox.

Description
The Red fox has orange-red fur. The females are called vixens, and the males are called reynard or dogs. Baby Red foxes are called kits.

Behaviour

Diet
A Red fox's diet would be of small rodents, rabbits, and birds. Even insects and plants will do. Red foxes are omnivores. So they eat plants, but mostly meat.

Territorial behaviour
Red foxes are territorial, so they have a territory. If you enter a Red fox's territory, the leader will most likely growl at you, or try to bite. Of course, a fox's bite won't be a painful as a bear's or a wolf's, but it will still hurt, so stay out!

Habitat
Red foxes live up north, you can find them in Europe, and some places in Canada. But they do not go as far north as arctic foxes do, they stay a little further south.

Relationships with humans


In some countries, people can have them as pets
