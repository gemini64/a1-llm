Beech grove in spring, in Bulgaria.
Beech is a large type of tree. (Genus Fagus, family Fagaceae).
Beeches are native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. They are commonly grown as ornamental trees.
European beeches (Fagus sylvatica) have a silver-grey smooth thin bark and toothed deciduous leaves. They bear small fruits called nuts protected by husks known as cupules.
Beech wood is an excellent firewood and some drums are made from beech. It gives a utility timber used to build log cabins.
