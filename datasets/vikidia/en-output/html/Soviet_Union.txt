History

The Soviet Union was founded by Vladimir Lenin after the Russian Civil War (1917-1921). Lenin founded a dictatorship, with gulags (concentration camps for political opposants) and the Cheka (a political police force, which later became the KGB).
From 1929 to 1953, it was lead by general-secretary Joseph Stalin, who extended the totalitarianism established by Vladimir Lenin. Like Lenin, he used massive propaganda. His regime caused more than twenty millions deaths.
After the death of Stalin in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev took power.
In 1961 the Soviets sent the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin.
From 1985 to 1991, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev reformed the Soviet Union with democratc laws, believed by some to have lead to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union. (*)  The Soviet Union was dissolved on 25 December 1991.
