An erection is when a male’s penis becomes stiff, hard, and long. Erections occur for various reasons, such as sexual excitement or even spontaneously. Biologically, erections occur so a male can insert his penis into a vagina for sexual intercourse.
Erections usually begin to occur frequently after early puberty and continue for most of a man’s life. They are usually accompanied by a strong urge to have sex or masturbate. If a boy stimulates his erection continuously, he may experience a highly pleasurable feeling called orgasm, as well as the ejaculation of semen.
