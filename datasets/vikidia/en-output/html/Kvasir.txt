Kvasir was the wisest of the Norse gods. At the end of the war between the Aesir and the Vanir, each of the gods contributed their saliva to finalise the truce between them. From this mix of their saliva was born Kvasir, who was blessed with the wisdom of all the gods, as he was born from parts of them. He travelled the world spreading peace and knowledge, beloved by all, until eventually he was tricked by two dwarves, Fjarlar and Garlar, and was murdered by them. They drained him of his blood and made mead from it, which became the Mead of Poetry, which blessed anybody who drank it with enough of Kvasir's wisdom to produce beautiful poems.
