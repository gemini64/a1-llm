Source code
Source code is a written set of instructions that a computer program follows. It is written in a programming language that is understandable for humans but not for computers. Therefore, the computer needs to translate or interpret it into a language that it can understand and execute the program.
Most computer applications do not have the source code available. If it is available, it allows the user, programmer or system administrator to modify the program or understand how it works.
