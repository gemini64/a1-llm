Dutch Sign Language (Dutch: Nederlandse Gebarentaal) is a sign language used by the deaf and hearing impaired communities in the Netherlands and some parts of Belgium (alongside Flemish Sign Language / Vlaamse Gebarentaal).  Its usage when last measured in 2016 amounts to approximately 22,500 people, 7,500 for whom it is their first and only language, and a further 15,000 who use it as a supplemental language (either for interpretation or as a complement to having speech). It is recognised in the Netherlands as a native language of the country, alongside spoken Dutch.
