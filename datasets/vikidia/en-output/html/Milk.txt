A glass of milk
Milk is a drink made by female mammals to feed their young.
Most milk we drink in Western countries comes from cows. It is an important food for people.
In other countries, milk comes from goats, sheep and other animals.
Milk is mostly water, with fat, protein, sugar, calcium, and other minerals and vitamins.
Cow milk often has vitamins A and D added for nutrition.
In many countries milk is homogenized to mix the fat all through the drink.
It is often pasteurized which heats the milk to kill microorganisms and make it safe to drink.
In some places, milk is heated to very high temperatures so it can be stored in a box or bag at normal room temperature without needing to be stored in a cool place.
