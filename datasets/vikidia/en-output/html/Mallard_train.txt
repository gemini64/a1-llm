The Mallard is the name of a locomotive for express trains created by the British railroad company London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The Mallard was first put into service on 3 March 1938 and retired in 1963, 25 years and nearly 2.3 millions of kilometers later.
The Mallard is part of a series of 35 similar locomotives known as the A4 series. It was however given special care in view of attempting to break speed records. On 3 July 1938, the Mallard reached a speed of 202.8 km/h : that is, still today, the world record of speed for steam locomotives.
