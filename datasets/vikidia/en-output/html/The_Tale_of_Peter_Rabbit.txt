Peter Rabbit, his mother and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail
The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. It was published in 1902 by Frederick Warne & Company. It was a huge success.

Background
Potter wrote the tale of Peter Rabbit in a letter to child friend Noel Moore. He was sick in bed, and Potter wanted to cheer him. Peter Rabbit was named after her own rabbit. Later, the boy's mother told Potter that the tale should be published.
Potter made the tale ready for publication, but it was rejected by several publishers. The pictures were drawn in black and white, but publishers wanted the pictures to be colored. Potter would not color the pictures, so she used her own money to publish the tale as she had written and drawn it. The book was a success among friends.
At this time, small books for children were hugely popular, and the publishing house of Frederick Warne & Company wanted to produce them. Warne's published Peter Rabbit after having rejected it at first, and after Potter colored the pictures. The book was a huge success.

Story

The story is about a rabbit named Peter. His mother warns him to be a good rabbit. As soon as she leaves for the market, Peter runs to Mr. MacGregor's garden, slips under the gate, and eats the vegetables. His stomach aches. He tries to find the way home.
Mr. MacGregor chases him through the garden. Peter cannot find the garden gate. Mr. MacGregor shuts Peter in a shed, but he escapes, finds the gate, squeezes beneath it, and runs home. He is so weary, his mother puts him to bed with a dose of chamomile tea.

Adaptations

Toys, games, stuffed animals, handkerchiefs, and dishes were manufactured following the tale's successful publication. Peter Rabbit has been adapted to a short animated movie, and also adapted to a ballet with choreography by Sir Frederick Ashton.
