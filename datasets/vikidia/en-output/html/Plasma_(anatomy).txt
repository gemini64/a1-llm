Plasma is a constituent part of blood. It is a clear, pale yellow liquid, which carries blood cells around the body.  Plasma and blood cells can be separated and used as different treatments for people who are injured.  Some medicines are also made from agents found in blood, such as Factor 8, which is given to people with a rare disease called Hemophilia, which causes the sufferer to bleed uncontrollably. Factor 8 helps their blood to clot.
