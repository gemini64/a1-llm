Corned beef and cabbage
Corned beef and cabbage is a traditional Irish-American dish. It is served on St Patrick's Day in the United States. In Ireland, it is made with bacon, but Irish immigrants to America in the 19th century used corned beef instead of bacon. Corned means "preserved with salt". Irish soda bread might be served with the dish. Boiled potatoes and carrots are sometimes added to the mix.
