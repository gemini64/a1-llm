Birthplace of Helios: The Greek island of Rhodes, famous for the huge ancient statue of him.

Also, the island of Thrinacia was said by Homer to be Helios' special territory, but its actual location is unknown. Any bright, sun-bathed Greek island can be thought of as his, but that doesn't narrow the field very much, as the description applies to almost any Greek island.
