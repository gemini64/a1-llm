On Facebook, you can register an account, create groups and communities, and post or send messages to your friends. To be registered as a user on Facebook, you have to use your email. The minimum age requirement for joining is 13.

Website
The site uses blue as its signature colors as Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind. He says that "blue is the richest color for meâ€”I can see all of blue." The website is built by PHP in C++ and Facebook has little windows where you can chat with your friend or play minigames.
