Snow is a type of precipitation that is made up of ice crystals. Snowflakes are the pieces of snow that fall from the sky.
The process of snow precipitation is called snowfall. A blizzard is a very strong snow storm.
Snowfall usually occurs in regions that aren't near the equator or that are at a high elevation (on mountains, for example), especially during the season of winter.
