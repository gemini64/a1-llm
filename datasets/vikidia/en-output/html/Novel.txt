Robinson Crusoe
A novel is a story, or narrative, that is long enough to be a book on its own.
Novels are narratives written in prose (not poetry and not rhyming) fiction.
Most novels are 60,000 words or longer, but sometimes they can be shorter.
They tell stories about the same characters from beginning to end.
Novels were written as long ago as ancient Egypt, Japan, Greece, and other countries.
The earliest novel written in English was Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1719).
Novels became very popular in the 1800s and many authors began writing whose books are still famous today.
