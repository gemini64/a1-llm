The Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad (National Language Action Committee) emerged as a beacon of linguistic activism during a crucial period in the history of the Bengali language. Founded on October 1, 1948, by Nurul Huq Bhuiyan, a prominent Bengali politician and intellectual, the organization played a pivotal role in the Bengali Language Movement, a defining struggle for the recognition and official status of Bengali in Pakistan.
