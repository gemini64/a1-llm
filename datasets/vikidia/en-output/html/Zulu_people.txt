The Zulu people (Zulu: amaZulu) are a native people of Southern Africa of the Nguni.
The Zulu people founded the Zulu Kingdom in 1816 under their leader Shaka. In 1879, the British Empire and Zulu Kingdom went to war in the Anglo-Zulu War when the Zulu rejected British rule. The Zulus won an early victory at the Battle of Isandlwana but were defeated by the British at the Battle at Rorke's Drift, and decisively defeated the Zulu army by July at the Battle of Ulundi.
Misuzulu Zulu is the current King of the Zulu Nation.
