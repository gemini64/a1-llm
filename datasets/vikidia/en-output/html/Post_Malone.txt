Known for his varied vocals, Malone has been acclaimed for blending the genres and subgenres of hip hop, pop, R&B and trap. His stage name was derived from entering his birth name into a rap name generator.

Early life
Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. Aged nine, he and his family moved to Dallas, Texas, after his father became an assistant for the Dallas Cowboys, an American football team. He became passionate about basketball after attending a Dallas Mavericks game, then began playing guitar.

Career
His pseudonym was rumored to be a reference to professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that "Post" was his last name, and that he inserted it into a rapper name generator.
