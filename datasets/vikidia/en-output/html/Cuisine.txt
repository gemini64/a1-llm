Cuisine is really just a name for a certain places' way of cooking their foods. The cuisine starts in a native place and is part of its cultural heritage.

Local cuisine for travelers
People who travel may be introduced to a new or "foreign" cuisine in their destination, especially if it's far from their place of origin.

Immigrant cuisines
When native peoples emigrate to live in other places, they often cook and bake their familiar cuisine in their new homes. Some emigrants will make a living in the new location by opening a restaurant or grocery store, often importing special ingredients needed to cook the cuisine's dishes. People who have traveled or who want to experience new foods and flavors will enjoy these restaurants and even buy the ingredients to cook at home.

Cooking foreign cuisines
People who want to cook foreign food at home need to learn from someone teaching them, or from written recipes. There are cooking shows on television and instructional videos on Internet channels such as YouTube. There are cookbooks of recipes, often with illustrations, in many languages. These explain the dishes, ingredients, and special equipment that may be needed.
