Volume is how loud or soft a sound is. Volume is measured in decibels (db). Volume can be adjusted by a knob like the one in a car. Loud volume is not good for your ears for an extended period of time. Generally anything over 90 decibels is harmful to your ears. However, short periods of time listening to something over 90 decibels is ok. Generally bigger waves is louder volume and little waves for soft volume.
