Historical Background:
The roots of Martyred Intellectuals Day trace back to the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a conflict that emerged from the struggle for independence from Pakistan. As the war intensified, the Pakistani military junta targeted intellectuals, including academics, writers, journalists, and professionals, in an attempt to cripple the intellectual backbone of the Bengali nation.
The atrocities committed during this dark period resulted in the systematic killing of countless intellectuals who were perceived as symbols of the Bengali nationalist movement. Many were abducted, tortured, and subsequently executed on the eve of the victory of the allied forces.
