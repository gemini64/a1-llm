lottery tickets
Lottery is a game of chance in which people buy a ticket with some numbers in it and if that number matches the one that wins a draw, the owner of the ticket receives money or something else.
The game is so old that it is believed that lottery sales could have been used to help finance the construction of the Great Wall of China and in Ancient Rome there were lotteries where people could win slaves, among other things.
