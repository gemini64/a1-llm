Pigeons and doves are a family of birds (scientific name : Columbidae). The bird's origin is tracked to Australia. It now lives around the world, except in uninhabitable places like the Sahara desert and Antarctica.
They are quite familiar to humans, since many species use to live in towns. Some of them have also been domesticated.
