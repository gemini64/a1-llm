A vampire
A Vampire is a fictitious creature that sucks the blood of human beings. Human beings who are bitten by a vampire, turn into vampires themselves.
Vampires are afraid of garlic, stakes and crucifixes, and their image cannot be seen in a mirror.  They can only die if exposed to sunlight, shot with a silver bullet, or by being impaled (stabbed) through the heart with a long wooden pole called a stake.
Dracula was one of the most famous vampires in the world, he also could transform into a bat, something most vampires could not do. A typical vampire is very pale, has superhuman strength and sharp, long canine teeth.
