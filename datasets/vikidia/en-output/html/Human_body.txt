Human skeleton
The Human body is the physical part of a human person.  In an adult, it consists of a skeleton made up of 206 bones, attached to which are 639 muscles.  The human body contains 100 organs and has approximately 5 to 8 litres (10.5 to 16.8 pints) of blood, which circulates around the body through every part, thanks to the heart and a network of veins, arteries and capillaries.
The body consists of many different systems, all of which have different functions in keeping a person alive:

The Nervous system (Brain, Nerves): The control system for the body;



The Circulatory system (Blood vessels, Heart): This system circulates blood through the body;



The Respiratory system (Lungs, Diaphragm): The oxygen delivery system;



The Reproductive system (Genitals, Ovaries and Testicles): Parts of the process for creating new life;



The Digestive system (Stomach, Liver, Intestines): This system turns food and drink into energy and chemicals needed to live, and also deals with the removal of solid waste (Feces) via the Rectum;



The Immune system (Spleen, Tonsils, Lymph glands): The system for defense and protection of the body;



The Endocrine system (Pancreas, Thyroid gland): This system deals with production and distribution of Hormones;



The Urinary system (Bladder, Kidneys): This system removes waste liquid (Urine) from your body.


To preserve the human body, it is necessary to eat healthy foods and drink plenty of water.
These foods are:

Fruits and Vegetables: Many fruits and vegetables have important vitamins which help to provide nutrients to the body, and fight off some illnesses.
Meat: Meat gives us protein, fats and oils, and a small amount of carbohydrates.
Fish:  Fish supplies our brains with omega 3, which is especially good for the elderly and those with heart problems.
Dairy and dairy alternatives:  Dairy and some dairy alternatives contain Calcium, which is essential for keeping our bones and teeth strong.
