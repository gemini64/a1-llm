Hypnos (to the Greeks) or Somnus (to the Romans) is the personification of sleep. Depicted as a man with wings on either side of his head(or brow) or shoulders. He is the child of Nyx and Erebus and a brother to death aka Thanatos (the Greek personification of death). He is seen with a horn of opium, a poppy stem, a branch that's been dipped in the River Lethe (forgetfulness), or an inverted torch, all of which are sleep-inducing. He is even known to have put Zeus to sleep but was not caught because he hid with his mother Nyx. Hypnos resides in the underworld.
