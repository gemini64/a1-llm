The Scottish Parliament is the parliament of Scotland, located in Edinburgh. The parliament is also called Holyrood and has 129 members.
Following the 1997 referendum, the parliament was established in 1999. The Scots can since 1999 arrange some of their own policies. In 2012 and 2016 those powers are extended. The Scottish Parliament is elected for five years. As with all elections in the UK, qualifying voters from Ireland or any country of the commonwealth of Nations can vote. Unlike the other elections, also inhabitants from EU member states can vote. Since the 2016 elections, 16 and 17-year olds can vote as well.
The Scottish National Party forms the coalition with 62 of the 129 members. The opposition is formed by the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Green Party, one independent member and presiding officer.
