Jersey is a Crown dependency of the United Kingdom. It is located in the English Channel near the coast of France as part of the Channel Islands.
Jersey is a part of the UK, but governs itself. The UK does provide services like protection in times of war and trade relations with other countries. In trade Jersey has a special relationship with the European Union.
British culture is dominant on Jersey. Most people speak French as well as English. JÃ¨rriais, the local language, is quite similar to French and is one of the two official languages. The capital of the island is Saint Helier.
The Jersey pound is the official currency, but it is linked to the Pound sterling, meaning that one pound is even as much as one Jersey pound. Nonetheless, people have to change their currency if they visit the island.
