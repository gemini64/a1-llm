Sharks are a group of fish. They are the main members of the cartilaginous fishes class.
Most known sharks have long, elongated, torpedo-shaped bodies, with huge jaws and sharp teeth; they are carnivorous predators and hunt other animals such as fish, squids, and seals.
There are hundreds of species of sharks. They vary in shape and size, from the little small-spotted catshark to the giant whale shark which feeds on plankton.
