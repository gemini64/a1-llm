The Greek language is the official language of Greece. It is also the official language in Cyprus. In Greek, the language is called Ελληνικά (elliniká). The language is spoken by around 13.1 million people.
Greek has been a written language for over 3,000 years. This is longer than any other European and south Asian language spoken or written today. This history is often divided into three parts: ancient Greek, medieval Greek, and modern Greek. Medieval Greek was during the time of the Byzantine Empire (*) .
Greeks in Eastern Orthodox churches now worship using a mixture of modern Greek and some from Byzantine writings.
