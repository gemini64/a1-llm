DuckDuckGo is an Internet search engine. Its slogan is "The search engine that doesn't track you." Its name comes from the children's game duck, duck, goose.
Safari added DuckDuckGo as a search engine option in September 2014, and Firefox added it in November 2014. Safari and Firefox are currently the only major browsers that offer DuckDuckGo as a search engine choice.
