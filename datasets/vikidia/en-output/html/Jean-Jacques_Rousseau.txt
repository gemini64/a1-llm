Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Geneva, 28 June 1712 - 2 July 1778), was an important philosopher, political theorist, writer and self-taught composer. He is considered one of the leading philosophers of the Enlightenment and a forerunner of romanticism. His political philosophy influenced the Enlightenment across Europe as well as aspects of the French Revolution and the modern development of economics, politics, and educational thought.  He also composed the 1 act operetta "Le Devin du Village", first performed on 18 October 1752, at Fontainebleu, before Louis XV.
For him, traditional educational institutions corrupt man and take away his freedom. For the creation of a new man and a new society, it would be necessary to educate children in accordance with Nature, progressively developing their senses and reason with a view to freedom and the ability to judge.
