This act rejected the last vassal relations of Bulgaria with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria became an independent country led by Prince Ferdinand I who was called the Bulgarians' tsar.
Bulgaria is the home of folklore, one in which there is no occasion to celebrate with dances and folk costumes.One of the most important festivals is the Kukeri, which takes place in the last days of winter (usually a nice February) as greeting to the spring that is coming. It is only men who participate, wearing clothes made of sheepskin and copper bells hanging from their belts. The masks are made of shreds and woolen hoods
