Foot en pointe in a pointe shoe
Pointe technique is a ballet term describing steps performed en pointe, or on the tips of the toes. A special shoe called a pointe shoe is worn to perform pointe work, and instruction generally begins at age 11.
Pointe technique was developed in the early and middle 19th century to give the ballerina the appearance of being lighter than air. It gained widespread notice and appreciation in 1832 when ballerina Marie Taglioni danced almost entirely en pointe in the romantic ballet called La Sylphide.
