Circa is a Latin word meaning "approximately" or "about".  It is used when giving details about something for which an exact time or period in history isn't known - for example, "The house was built circa 1800" means that the house was built around the year 1800, but the exact date isn't known.
Circa is a loan word, which means even though it is used in English, it comes from another language.
