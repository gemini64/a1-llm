Thoughts on Eir
Eir is implied to be counted among the Asujnur, the major goddesses of the Æsir. Her distinction as a servant of both Frigg and Óðin, as well as her sphere of influence, have earned her a place of veneration among modern Heathens. There are several other deities who are sometimes called upon for help with healing. Eir, however is the preeminent and principal healer in Northern tradition.
Before the rise of the male dominated medical institutions of Europe, the healing and medical care of the community in Norse and Germanic countries was largely the sphere of women. Although the Sagas record several male healers, during the pagan period the role of doctor was women’s work, while men were usually nurses or helpers.
Healing methods among proto-Heathens included: healing through prayers, magic, midwifery practices (which were more advanced than those that followed after), surgery, herbalism, home remedies, healing methods using copper bracelets, and detoxes using saunas.
She is sometimes compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia. She may be related to the Indo-European Swiss goddess, Erecura, known to the Celts as Aerucura.
