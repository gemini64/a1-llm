Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub
Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, commonly known as Saladin, was a Muslim ruler of Kurdish origin who founded the Ayyubid dynasty. He was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and played a crucial role in the Third Crusade, leading the Muslim military against the Crusader states in the Levant. During his reign, the Ayyubid Empire expanded to include Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen, and Nubia.

Birth and Early Life:
Saladin was born in Tikrit, present-day Iraq. His name was Yusuf, but he was also known by the nickname "Salladin," which means "goodness of faith." His family likely had Kurdish origins and hailed from the village of Azdanakan near the town of Divin in central Armenia. In 1164, Saladin was sent to Egypt under the Fatimid Caliphate, accompanying his uncle Shirkuh on the orders of Nur-ad-Din. He played a crucial role in quelling the Christian rebellion and establishing Ayyubid rule in the region.
