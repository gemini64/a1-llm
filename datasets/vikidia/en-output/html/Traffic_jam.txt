A traffic jam is when vehicles are all stuck on a road traveling very slowly with tons of cars.

Causes

Busy. Sometimes it is so busy it forms a traffic jam.
Car/truck accident. They block a lane from the road usually which makes cars merge and move much slower.
Construction. Like car accidents, they block a lane or 2 which makes cars slow.
Narrow road. Just not many lanes on a road.
