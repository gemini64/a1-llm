Mary, carried by angels
Among Catholic and Orthodox Christians, the Assumption of Mary is the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, at the end of her time on Earth, was ascended to Heaven in both body and soul.
It was proclaimed revealed truth by Pope Pius XII in 1950, although artistic representations of the subject had already been made long before.
