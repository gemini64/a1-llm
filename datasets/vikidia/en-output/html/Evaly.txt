Evaly is an e-commerce marketplace founded by Mohammad Russell in December 2018. It operates in Bangladesh. The company's strategy of attracting customers with attractive offers has created excitement and criticism. In 2021, Evaly was accused of financial irregularities, including fraud; despite operating in Bangladesh, their e-commerce website was only available in English. On 16 October 2021, Evaly announced the closure of their website and mobile app. However, in October 2022, the company resumed operations with a new initiative.
