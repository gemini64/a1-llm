Scrooge McDuck is a Disney character invented by Carl Barks. He is Donald Duck's uncle. He is a miserly, grumpy multi-billionaire who lives in a vault on top of a hill. He is considered the richest man in the world and his main rivals are Gripsou, Flairsou, Miss Tick and the Rapetout.
Scrooge is always dressed in a black top hat, a red or blue frock coat depending on the version and a pair of small round glasses that he wears on his beak.
Scrooge was born in Scotland and then left to make his fortune in America. He made his first millions during the gold rush and earned the rest by investing.
