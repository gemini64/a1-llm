Magh is the tenth month of the Bengali calendar. It is named after the Sun's position in Magha Nakshatra. Magha and Paush are the two winter months. According to the Caesarian calendar, the Magha month falls between mid-January and February. It usually lasts 30 days, but sometimes it may rain towards the end of the month. There is a saying that goes, "Tiger flees in winter", and this month marks the arrival of mango buds. As Khana says, "If the end of the year is Magh, the holy land of the blessed king". The full moon of the month of Magh is called Maghi Purnima. Saraswati Puja is celebrated on the fifth day of Magha month, known as Shukla Panchami Tithi. Magha month is the subject of many poems.
