Biological classification is also called taxonomy which is a scientific way of sorting plants and animals into different groups.
The theory of evolution says that living organisms gradually change and that related organisms descend from common ancestors. One thing that classification does is produce groups arranged so that the smallest groups contain organisms that are closely related. The major divisions are kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.
