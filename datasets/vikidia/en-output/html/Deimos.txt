Deimos was a God in Ancient Greek Mythology he was the God of personification of terror (dread.) He was the son of Ares and Aphrodite and has a twin brother named Phobos (fear) which is where the word phobia comes from. Although he wasnt in any stories of Greek Mythology he was a mere representation of terror that is brought upon humans by war.
