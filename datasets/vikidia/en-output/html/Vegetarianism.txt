Fruit stall in Barcelona, Spain
Vegetarianism is the practice of consuming fruits, vegetables, and other plants rather than the flesh of animals. The term dates to Britain in the middle of the 19th century.
The reasons for vegetarianism may be ethical, political, economic, health-related, or other. Some vegetarian sects permit the consumption of eggs, milk, and cheese. Vegans follow these food practices, but also avoid fur, wool, leather, and other animal byproducts in their daily lives, including cheese and milk.
