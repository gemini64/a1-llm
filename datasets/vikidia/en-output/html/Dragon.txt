thumb|a dragon
A dragon is a mythological creature that resembles a large reptile. They are often depicted with large claws and wings.
They are present in many mythologies; For example, we distinguish between Western and Eastern dragons, since they are fictional and the artists who depicted them have different visions of dragons.
The body of the western dragon is made up of several animals: the head of a reptile, the eyes and neck of a snake, the body covered with scales, the clawed legs of an eagle, and the wings of a bat.
Eastern (most often Asian) depictions of these creatures show them wingless and with a long mustache. Sometimes they are covered with feathers instead of scales.
They are often depicted spitting fire from their mouths.
