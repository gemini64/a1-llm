Muhammad Yunus is the Chief Adviser of the Interim govt. of Bangladesh. (*)  He is mostly known as an economist, social entrepreneur, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate renowned for his groundbreaking work in the field of microfinance. (*)


Born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, Yunus has dedicated his career to addressing poverty and empowering marginalized communities through innovative financial solutions. (*)

Early Life and Education
Muhammad Yunus completed his undergraduate and master's degrees in economics at Dhaka University in Bangladesh. He later pursued his Ph.D. in economics at Vanderbilt University in the United States.

Microfinance and Grameen Bank
Yunus' pivotal contribution to the world of finance came with the development of the concept of microcredit. In the 1970s, he began experimenting with lending small amounts of money to impoverished individuals in rural Bangladesh. His efforts culminated in establishing the Grameen Bank in 1983.
The Grameen Bank, founded by Yunus, revolutionized banking by providing micro-loans to people experiencing poverty, particularly women, who lacked access to traditional financial institutions. The bank's success in empowering individuals to create and expand small businesses earned Yunus the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

Impact and Expansion
Under Yunus's leadership, Grameen Bank became a global model for microfinance. The concept of providing financial services to people experiencing poverty, known as microcredit or microfinance, has spread to various parts of the world, transforming the lives of millions by offering them a path out of poverty.

Social Business and Other Initiatives
Apart from his work in microfinance, Yunus advocates for the concept of social business. He believes in the power of business to address social issues and founded the Grameen Danone Foods Ltd., a joint venture that produces nutritious yogurt for malnourished children in Bangladesh.
Yunus has also been involved in various other initiatives, including healthcare, renewable energy, and education, all aimed at addressing the root causes of poverty.

Awards and Recognition
Muhammad Yunus has received numerous awards and honours for his social and economic development contributions. In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, he has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
