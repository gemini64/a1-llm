Lalbagh Fort
Lalbagh Fort (Kila Aurangabad) is an unfinished Mughal fort located on the banks of the river Buriganga in the south-west of Dhaka. Its construction began in 17 AD by the Mughal subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah, who was the son of Emperor Aurangzeb and later became emperor himself. His successor, Mughal subaddar Shaista Khan, resumed construction in 180, but did not finish.

History
Azam Shah, the 3rd son of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Mughal prince, started its construction in 16 AD while he was the subaddar of Bengal. He was in Bengal for 15 months. Before the construction of the fort was completed, his father Emperor Aurangzeb summoned him to Delhi to quell the Maratha rebellion. At this time, after the construction of a mosque and a court hall, the construction of the fort stopped. Subaddar Shaista Khan came to Dhaka again in 180 AD as the subadar of Bengal and resumed the construction of the fort. In 184, Rahmat Banu (Peri Bibi), daughter of Shaista Khan, died here. After the death of his daughter, Shaista Khan considered the fort a misfortune and stopped its construction unfinished in 164 AD. One of the three main installations of Lalbagh fort is the tomb of Pari Bibi. It lost its popularity after Shaista Khan left Dhaka. The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad; This was the main reason. After the end of the royal Mughal period, the fort remained in an abandoned state. In 1844, the area was renamed "Aurangabad" and "Lalbagh" and the fort became Lalbagh Fort.
