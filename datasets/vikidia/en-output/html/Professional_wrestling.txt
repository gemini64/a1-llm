A professional wrestling match
Professional wrestling is a sport and a performing art. While it pretends to be a sport, it involves a choreographed scenario and a pre-determined outcome.
Professional wrestlers dress in gaudy costumes, have intimidating nicknames, and quarrel over their belts and titles, their unblemished reputations, and their girlfriends.
Professional wrestling has been bashed as "male soap opera", but it is hugely popular with men and boys.
