Lake Michigan, in dark blue, among the Great Lakes
Lake Michigan is one of the Great Lakes of North America.
Lake Michigan is bounded by Michigan to the north and east, Indiana to the south, Illinois to the southwest, and Wisconsin to the west.  It is the only one of the Great Lakes claimed solely by the United States, and is cut off from the other lakes at the Mackinaw Bridge.  Major cities on the shore of the lake include Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and for that reason, it is a popular place for various ships which need the access to the heartland best granted at Chicago.
It is a somewhat beautiful lake according to the Rand McNally 2016 Road Atlas, particularly as viewed from Route 31 and small beachside roads on the Michigan side.  It's a pity so much of the view is obscured by houses, but that is a more profitable way to develop.
