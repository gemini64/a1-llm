Flotation is a process. It is used to separate sulfide ores from the gangue, the impurities in the ore. A detergent is added to the mixture and it is stirred. The sulfide minerals float, while the gangue sinks to the bottom and is removed. This is used in making zinc, where zinc sulfide (sphalerite) is a major zinc ore.
