White Rhinoceros mother and baby
The rhinoceros (commonly called rhino) is a large mammal. The rhinoceros is famous for the horn or horns growing above the nose and a thick armor-like hide. Rhinoceroses are vegetarians.

Species
There are five species: two in Africa and three in south Asia. Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn. All rhino species are considered extremely endangered.

Endangered status
With their numbers in the wild decreasing, rhinos are protected by law and hunting them is illegal. (See below: "Illegal trade")
There are some efforts in zoos and animal sanctuaries worldwide to breed rhinos and increase their populations. However, this is a slow process and not likely to make a meaningful difference to the global populations.

Illegal trade

Source of the problem
Some cultures consider a powder made from rhino horn to have medicinal properties. The horn is composed of keratin, the same ingredient in hair and fingernails. The value of this substance has created an illegal, "black market" for obtaining it and trading in it. Illegal hunters are called "poachers."

Possible solutions

Protecting rhinos

Training and equipping rangers in the field, including the use of tracker dogs  (*)
