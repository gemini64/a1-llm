A bull giraffe in South Africa

Description

The giraffe is a long-necked, long-legged animal that lives in the grasslands of Africa. The front and hind legs have approximately the same length. The giraffe's neck can reach a maximum of two metres in length. Their teeth are very large, but it is difficult to see them. They have a long tongue. The royal giraffe extends into South Africa and Somalia. Giraffes are commonly found on savannahs and prairies or in woods. Their main food is Acacia leaves.  Giraffes have been known to weigh up to 1930 kg or 4340 lbs and grow up to 19 ft tall.

Scientific denomination and classification

The Giraffe is the tallest living animal in existence.  It is classified in the scientific family Giraffidae. The only other animal still alive today in that group is the Okapi.

Behaviour

Giraffes eat around 34 kg / 75 lbs of leaves a day and live in warm places. They usually move quite slowly, but when threatened, they can run at quite fast speeds because of the length of their stride.  They can live without water for longer than a month.

Habitat

Giraffes usually live in the savannahs, on prairies and open woodlands of Africa. They prefer Acacia and open woodlands over denser environments.
