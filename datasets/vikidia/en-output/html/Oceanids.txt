The Oceanids In Greek mythology were fanciful sea-nymphs. According to the Greek poet Hesiod, the nymphs were the daughters of the Titans Okeanos and Tethys. The word Oceanid comes from the name Okeanos, which is also spelled Oceanus. "Hesiod claims that there were three thousand of these sea-nymphs who inhabited the waters." (*)
Hesiod lists the names of many of the Oceanids in his Theogony, which is a poem that tells about the birth of the Greek gods and goddesses. The names of these sea-nymphs are very unusual. There are named in this quotation from:


“They are Peitho, Admete, Ianthe, and Electra,
Doris, Prymno, and godlike Ourania,
Hippo, Klymene, Rhodeia, and Kallirhoe,
Zeuxo, Klytia, Idyia, and Peisithoe,
Plexaura, Galaxaura, and lovely Dione,
Melobosis, Thoe, and beautiful Polydora,
shapely Kerkeis and cow-eyed Plouto,
Perseis, Ianeira, Akaste, and Xanthe,
lovely Petraia, Menestho, and Europe,
Metis, Eurynome, and saffron-robed Telesto,
Chryseis, Asia, and enchanting Kalypso,
Eudora, Tyche, Amphiro, and Okyrhoe,
and Styx, who holds the highest rank.
These are the eldest daughters born to Tethys
and Okeanos.” (*)
