A pidgin is a language with a very small vocabulary (often consisting of a few hundred words) that exists so people who don't speak the same language can understand each other. Sometimes pidgin languages can evolve into a full language, and these languages are called Creoles. The most notable is Haitian Creole, which has often mistakenly been referred to as just "Creole".
