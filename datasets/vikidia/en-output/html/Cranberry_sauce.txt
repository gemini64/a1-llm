Cranberries cooking on the stove top
Cranberry sauce or cranberry jelly is an American dish made of cranberries, water, and white, granulated sugar. The dish is simple enough to be made at home, but canned sauces and jellies are available in grocery stores.
The dish is usually served with turkey, duck, chicken, or goose. In the United States, it is a traditional dish at the Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner tables, and rarely served at other times.
