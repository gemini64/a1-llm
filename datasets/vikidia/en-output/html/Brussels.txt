The Great Marketplace of Brussels
Brussels is the capital and most populous city of Belgium. The urban area had 1.892 million people according to a 2009 estimate. (*)
Brussels is also one of three regions of Belgium, the two other ones being Flanders and Wallonia. The Brussels region has two official languages, French and Dutch. Many other languages are also spoken in Brussels because many immigrants live there and the city hosts several international organisations.
