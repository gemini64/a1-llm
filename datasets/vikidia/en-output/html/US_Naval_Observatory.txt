US Naval Observatory building in Wash. DC.
The United States Naval Observatory started in 1833 in Washington, D.C.
Its purpose was to determine the exact time of day by observing the stars. Time is very important for ships to find out where they are in the oceans and navigating (planning) their route.
The main station is in Flagstaff, Arizona.
