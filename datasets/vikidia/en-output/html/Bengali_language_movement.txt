The Bengali Language Movement, also known as the Bhasha Andolon, was a political movement in former East Bengal (renamed East Pakistan in 1955) advocating for the recognition of the Bengali language as an official language of the then-Dominion of Pakistan. The movement sought to allow the use of Bengali in government affairs, education, media, currency, and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the Bengali script.

Background
Bengali is the native language of over 265 million people, making it the second most spoken language in the world after Mandarin Chinese. In the early 20th century, Bengali was the dominant language in the eastern part of British India, which was known as Bengal. After the partition of India in 1947, Bengal was divided between India and Pakistan. The eastern part, which became East Pakistan, was home to over 50 million Bengalis.

Origins of the Movement
The Pakistani government, dominated by West Pakistani politicians, imposed Urdu as the sole official language of Pakistan in 1948. This decision was met with widespread protests from Bengalis, who saw it as an attempt to suppress their culture and identity.

Key Events
The Bengali Language Movement gained momentum in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A number of key events marked the movement's progress:

1948: The All Pakistan Studentsâ€™ Union demands that Bengali be made an official language alongside Urdu.
1949: The Bengali Language Movement Action Committee is formed to coordinate protests.
1952: On February 21, 1952, a large student demonstration in Dhaka is attacked by police, resulting in the deaths of several students. This day is now commemorated as Language Martyrs' Day in Bangladesh.
1956: After years of protests, the Pakistani government finally concedes to the demands of the Bengali Language Movement and grants Bengali official status alongside Urdu.



Impact
The Bengali Language Movement had a profound impact on Bangladeshi history and culture. It helped to unify Bengalis and strengthen their sense of national identity. The movement also played a key role in the eventual independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971.

Legacy
The Bengali Language Movement is remembered as a watershed moment in the struggle for linguistic rights and cultural preservation. It continues to inspire movements for linguistic justice around the world.
