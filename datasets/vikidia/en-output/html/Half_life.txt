In Chemistry, the Half life of an element is the time it takes for half of that element to break down, or decay.  For example, if you had 10 grams of a radioactive element, like Francium for example, after 1 half life (or 22 minutes) had passed, you would only have 5 grams.  After a 2nd half life or 44 minutes, you would only have 2.5 grams.  This continues until all the substance has gone.
