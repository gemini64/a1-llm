Shakemap in Kyrgyzstan
On August 19, 1992, a major earthquake hit in the border area of Kyrgyzstan. (*)  Maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. 75 people died, most of which were due to collapsed buildings throughout the valley and mass movements that occurred at Belaldy River.

Earthquake
The major earthquake occurred at 02:04 UTC, measuring M 7.5, at a depth of 17.0 kilometers. The earthquake ruptured an east-west-trending, south-dipping thrust fault in the Suusamyr Basin with the epicenter beneath the Aramsu Range. (*)

Aftershock
Three large aftershocks with magnitudes of M 6.6, M 6.6, and M 6.0 occurred west of the Aramsu Range, but their mechanisms and depths are unknown. The more than 900 aftershocks that were registered in the months after the Suusamyr Earthquake occurred at depths shallower than 15 km.

Aftermath
The Belaldy rock avalanche formed a landslide lake which burst ten months after the Suusamyr Earthquake in June 1993.
