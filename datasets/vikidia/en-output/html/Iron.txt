Iron is a magnetic metal found mainly in the Earth's core. It is less common in the crust. It is found in minerals combined with oxygen called oxides like hematite, magnetite, and taconite and many others. These minerals are crushed and heated to release pure or pig iron. This pure iron is further treated to make wrought iron, cast iron, and steel. In the human body, iron is important in blood and cells. Not enough iron in the body is called anemia.
