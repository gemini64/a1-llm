The PlayStation is a videgame console family created and released by Sony. These are known for being the most sold consoles in the 5th Generation (with the original PlayStation in 1996) and the 6th Generation (With the PlayStation 2).
Among the game consoles, PlayStation has standed out among it's competitors since it was the first console of having CD Readers that outperformed the cardridges from the Nintendo 64 after the unsucessful collaboration with Nintendoback in early 1990's during the development of a CD driver on the SNES.
