The constitution of a country (or a state) is a special type of document that tells how its government is supposed to work. (*)  A constitution is often called "the law of the land". (*)  Vote when used as a noun is "the system of fundamental principles according to which a nation, state, corporation, or the like, is governed." (*)
It tells how the country's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office. It tells how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed. A constitution explains who can vote and what other rights they are guaranteed. A constitution should also tell how it can be changed or amended. Limits are put on the government explaining how much power they have within the Constitution (see Rule of Law ). Some countries have a constitution but do not follow it.
