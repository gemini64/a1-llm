Geography
The Netherlands shares borders with Belgium in the south and with Germany in the east. Together with Belgium and Luxembourg, the Netherlands is a part of the Benelux region.
In the west the nation borders the North Sea. Further north is the Wadden Sea. The Wadden Sea is a part of the North Sea that dries up during low tide. It's a home for seals and various kinds of birds. Because of the unique environment, UNESCO recognized the tidal sea as world heritage. Some parts of the Wadden Sea also stay dry during high tide. These islands are called Waddeneilanden. A few of them are inhabited, they are Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland, Schiermonnikoog.
The Netherlands is home to the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta and because of that, there are lots of islands and streams. Large parts of the country consist of polders. A polder is a former lake, sea or swamp turned into land. About 27% of the country consists of polders and thus is man-made.
