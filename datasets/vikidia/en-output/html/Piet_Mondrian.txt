For copyright reasons, we cannot show an example of Mondrian's work. This is a homage to Mondrian by Henricke: it is a fair example of Mondrian's style.
Pieter Cornelis "Piet" Mondriaan (March 7, 1872, Amersfoort, the Netherlands â€“ February 1, 1944, New York City, United States) is a Dutch painter.

Early life and education
Mondrian enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam in 1892. He was 22 years old. Mondrian studied there from 1892-1895. He painted realistic paintings which were mostly landscapes of Holland early in his career. Later Mondrian simplified his paintings. He simplified by using shapes and colors. He became interested in the theosophical doctrine in 1892.

Composition
Mondrian discovered Cubism during a stay in Paris from 1911 to 1914. He gradually abandoned references to realism, retaining only the basic structures of forms. He no longer painted as horizontal and vertical lines that form parallel and perpendicular lines. There are more than the three primary colors used as well as white and black. His work then became a grid of black lines defining squares and rectangles of various sizes, forming spaces of pure colors.
After revenue declined in the Netherlands during World War II, Mondrian returned to Paris where he lived from 1919 to 1938. He moved to New York in 1940. Mondrian then abandoned the black lines for lines which formed small colored rectangles. This was called abstract art.
