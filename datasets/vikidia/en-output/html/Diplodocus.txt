The Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs to live. It is one of the best known long necked dinosaurs. It lived during the late Jurassic period, which was around 155.7 to 150.8 million years ago. Most of the diplodocus’ length was taken by its neck and tail.

Diet

The Diplodocus was a herbivore. A herbivore eats plants only. The Diplodocus may have swallowed stones to help with the digestion of all the plant material it ate. It also spent more time fermenting its food in its stomach then chewing the food.

Habitat

The Diplodocus roamed around western North America. Many fossils were found in the Rocky Mountains of western USA.

The Body

The Diplodocus was a long- necked dinosaur with a tail used for a whip. It's nose was on top of its head instead of being on the tip of its snout.The Diplodocus could not hold their necks above 17 ft. That meant that it may have had to stand on its two back legs to get leaves from the top of trees. It had one tooth replaced every 35 days.
