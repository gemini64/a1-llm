Suriname, also spelled as Surinam, is a country in South America. Suriname borders Guyana in the west, French Guiana in the east, Brazil in the south and the Caribbean Sea in the north. The capital is called Paramaribo and the official language is Dutch.
The country was a part of the Netherlands until 1975. Since then the country is independent, but there are close economic, cultural and political ties with the Netherlands. For example, there are as many Surinamese people living in the Netherlands as in Suriname itself.
