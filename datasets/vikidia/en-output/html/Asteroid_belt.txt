The asteroid belt is a region in the Solar System, shaped like a circumstellar disc, located in the Solar System, between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. This region is occupied by a large number of solid and irregularly shaped stellar bodies, of varying size but much smaller than planets, just asteroids or minor planets. This asteroid belt is also known as the main asteroid belt, or main belt, to distinguish it from other populations of asteroids in the Solar System, such as the near-Earth asteroids (NEA) or the Trojan asteroids.
