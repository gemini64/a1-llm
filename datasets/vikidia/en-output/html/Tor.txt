Tor (or The Onion Network) is a program that allows users to hide their identity. This means they cannot be tracked, and they will remain anonymous (secret). They do this by moving from server to server, so that it's hard for them to be traced. This makes searching this internet very slow. It can be used to access deep web sites (websites not available using Google).
