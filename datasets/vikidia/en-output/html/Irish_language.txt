Irish is daily spoken by 73,803 people in Ireland and by 4,166 in Northern Ireland. Irish isn't an official language in Northern Ireland, but it's a recognised minority language. The European Union thinks 141,000 people speak Irish as first language and 1,761,420 as second language. Irish is one of the official languages in the European Union.
