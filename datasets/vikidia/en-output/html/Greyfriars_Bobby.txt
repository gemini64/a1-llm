Story

The story is about a Skye terrier who spends every night for fourteen years sleeping on his master's grave, a poor homeless man named Old Jock. Two men in the neighborhood (a tavern keeper and a church sexton) become rivals in providing care and food for the dog, but Bobby belongs to no one but his dead master.
The children in the neighborhood put their pennies together to buy Bobby a collar and license, thus saving the little dog from being put down. Bobby becomes a superstar and loved he is given the freedom of Edinburgh.
