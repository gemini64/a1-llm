Process of acid rain.
Acid rain is a rain that because of the air pollution caused by human activity makes it acid. It causes damage to buildings, trees, animals, soil and people. Acid rain also harms crops, trees and other plants by causing direct damage to leaves.

Causes
Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station in Iceland.
Humans activities are the main cause of acid rain. This begins when compounds like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emitted by factories, vehicles and others are released into the air. These substances rise very high into the atmosphere, and then they mix and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals.

Effects
Effect of acid rain on statues.
Acid rain damges buildings seriously because it eats away at metal, plastic and stones. It affects the soil, reducing the amount of available nutrients. In humans, this can cause breathing problems or illnesses like cancer when particles of the acid enter to the body.
