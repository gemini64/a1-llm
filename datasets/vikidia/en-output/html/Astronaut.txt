An astronaut is basically a person who travels to space. It's like being an explorer, but instead of exploring new lands on Earth, astronauts explore the vast expanse of space beyond our planet.
So, what do astronauts do? They might go on missions to visit the International Space Station (ISS), which is like a giant space laboratory where scientists from all over the world conduct experiments in microgravity. Astronauts also conduct spacewalks outside of the space station to fix things, install new equipment, or just take in the breathtaking views of Earth from space.
But being an astronaut isn't just about floating around in zero gravity â€“ it's also about being super smart and well-trained. Astronauts undergo years of intense training to prepare for their missions. They learn about things like rocket science, space navigation, and how to operate spacecraft and space station systems. They also train for emergencies, like what to do if something goes wrong during a mission.
