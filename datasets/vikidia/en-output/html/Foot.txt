The foot (plural: Feet) is a part of the body of a large number of animals, including humans. It's the lowest part of the body. It's used for walking, balancing and in some creatures, notably Monkeys and others, like sloths, the digits on the foot can be used for picking things up, such as food.
Some humans have the ability to pick things up with their feet and hold them, like paint brushes and pens.  A foot consists of multiple bones and joints, such as toes and the ankle.
