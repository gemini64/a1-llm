A candle made of wax
Wax is a soft, yellowish material that softens in heat and becomes hard in cold. In addition, it does not dissolve with water (as it happens to sugar, for example). These characteristics make it easy to shape objects with this material.
Candles are made with wax. It is also used to polish wood, make soaps, small sculptures, paints and beauty creams.
Wax in a honeycomb
In addition to the wax artificially manufactured with different substances by man, this material is produced naturally by bees to make their honeycombs.
