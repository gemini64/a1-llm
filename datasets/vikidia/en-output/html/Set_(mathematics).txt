In math, a set is a collection of things.
For example, all the chairs in your house are a set. Your kitchen table is not a chair, so it is not in this set. A chair in your room is in the set.
When a thing is in a set, we say it is a member of the set.
You can list all the items in a set. That is one way to make a set. For example,
\{apple, pear, banana\}
Another way is to give a rule that tells which items are in a set. For example,
\{ \text{all the counting numbers} \}
Sets are used in math, computers, and Physics.
