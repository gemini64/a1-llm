"First Battle of Bull Run" by Kurz & Allison
The First Battle of Bull Run (aka First Manassas) was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, near the city of Manassas, not far from Washington, D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War. The Union forces were slow in positioning themselves. This situation allowed Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle. It was a Confederate victory followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces. The battle is also known as First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces).
