Pokémon is a video game created by Nintendo. It means Pocket Monsters.
A Pokémon is a creature often derived from animals (pidgey from pidgeon, rattata from rat), which can be caught by a designated ball such as a poké ball and a variety of other balls for better catching. The Pokémon are used for battle and completing a pokédex in most games.
There are many different types that are the following: fire, grass, water, normal, electric, bug, ghost, flying, fighting, psychic, steel, rock, ground, ice, poison, dark, dragon and fairy. Different Pokemon evolve into different types like Charmander evolves into Charmeleon and Charmeleon evolves into Charizard. But this chain carries on if you count Mega Evolution so Charizard evolves into either Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y. There are many Pokémon video games. The games in the main series and the regions are:
Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow (Kanto) Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald  (Hoenn) Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal  (Johto)  Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum (Sinnoh) Pokémon Black and White (Unova) Pokémon X and Y (Kalos), Pokémon Sun and Moon (Alola) and Pokémon Sword and shield (Galar).
