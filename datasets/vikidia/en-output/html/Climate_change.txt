Climate Change is the rapid change in the Climate of Earth, caused by human activity. This is not to be confused with weather, As Climate change is the result of long-term changes in weather patterns.
Climate Change on Earth is partially caused by the release of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere, which traps heat in the atmosphere causing a global rise in temperatures globally. It was first documented in 1896, by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius. (*)
