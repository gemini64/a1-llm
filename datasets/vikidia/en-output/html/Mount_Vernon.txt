Eastern view of Mount Vernon from the Potomac River
Mount Vernon is a house in the state of Virginia in the United States of America. It is on the banks of the Potomac River. Mount Vernon was the plantation home of George Washington, the first president of the United States, and his wife Martha Custis Washington. Washington began building the house in 1758.
The house declined after Washington's death in 1799. In 1858, the house's historical importance was recognized. It was saved from complete ruin by The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. The house was spared damage during the American Civil War, and restoration was undertaken. Mount Vernon became a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is today listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
