Lyrics

Current official

Golden sun sky,
The field of golden grain,
Epic of Courage,
Look at my country!
From ancient times the man,
We are famous.
Dishonored,
I am very proud!
My country, my country,
I will plant you as a flower,
I will sing, my people!
My homeland is Kazakhstan!
Paved the way for future generations,
I have a large area.
Unity is compatible,
I have an independent country.
Time to meet,
Like an eternal friend.
Our country is happy,
This is our country!
My country, my country,
I will plant you as a flower,
I will sing, my people!
My homeland is Kazakhstan!


1956 lyrics

Sun of gold in the sky,
Grain of gold in the steppe.
Let us all celebrate —
Take a look at the steppe!
How spacious is this land,
Flowers bloom on the ground.
Grains are with toil sowed —
My Kazakhs are intrepid!
My motherland, my motherland,
As thy song I shall stream from thee,
As thy flower I shall bloom, o homeland!
My native homeland – my Kazakhstan!
Around when I glance,
My heart with love filleth.
In this day I conform,
Behold my noble folk.
Our country – a vast land,
Our banners are raised.
In the wind they swayed,
In terme I rejoiced.
There is a looming steppe,
There is placid bounty.
O look and gratify,
I have such a country.
Of new eras welcomed,
Like an age-old friend.
Blessed is our country,
Such as our country!
