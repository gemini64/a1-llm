If the radius of a circle is known, pi can be used to calculate the circumference or area of the circle.
Pi (represented by the letter Ï€ in the Greek alphabet) is a mathematical constant. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it cannot be represented exactly with a fraction or decimal. 3.14159 is the approximate value of pi to the 5th decimal place.
