Leon Trotsky (1879-1940), born Lev Davidovich Bronshtein, was a (related to fighting authority or causing huge, important changes) socialist and, with Vladimir Lenin, leader of Russia's Bolshevik Revolution. From 1917-1924 Trotsky was commissar of foreign affairs and of war in the Soviet Union. He is often thought of as the person (who started a company) of the Red Army.
Trotsky was forced to leave the country in 1928 during Joseph Stalin's rise to power. He spent much of the rest of his life in an attempt to set up an international communist party. During his (permanent removal from a country), Trotsky continued to add/give to both the explanation (of why something works or happens the way it does) and practice of (related to fighting authority or causing huge, important changes) Marxism, further developing his explanation of the permanent revolution, continuously/very energetically criticizing the supposed "betrayal of socialism" in the USSR, and founding the Fourth International as an other choice to the Marxist-Leninist Comintern. He died in Mexico as the result of a fight with an assassin sent by Stalin. Although he managed the assassin was apprehended he was himself (resulting in death) wounded with an ice pick and died (more than two, but not a lot of) days later.
