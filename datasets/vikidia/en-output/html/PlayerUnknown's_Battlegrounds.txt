Gameplay
PUBG is a player vs. player action game where 100 players fight in Battle Royale, a large-scale Last Man Standing match is held, where players continue to fight to the end.
Each match begins with a parachute landing on a map measuring approximately 6 × 8 km (5.0 × 5.0 m). The flight path of the plane is at different places on the map depending on the match, players need to land on the ground by parachute in a quick and accurate place. Even if the players have customized their clothes from the east, it does not affect the game.
Once they land, players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor and other equipment. These items are effectively distributed across the map at the start of a match, especially in high-risk areas where there is usually good equipment. Kill other players as well as acquire their gears (equipment). Players can also play from a first person or third person perspective. Each has its own advantages as well as disadvantages in war and situational awareness.
Every few minutes, the playable area on the map begins to shrink to an irregular position, the amount of damage (damage) increases if any player is out of the safe zone, and the player is eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time. ; In the game, players see the border as a flashing blue wall that moves over time. As the amount of safe zones on the map gradually decreases, the chances of encounters between players increase. During the match, red and bomb blasts are highlighted in unspecified areas of the map, posing a threat to players in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before the incident, provided their safety replacement is provided. Randomly, a plane flies to different parts of the playable map and drops various necessary equipment through a loot package, which is not available during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, attracting interested players closer to it and making players more exposed. On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.
At each round completed, players gain in-game currency based on how long they have survived fighting, how many players they have killed, and how much damage other players have suffered. Coins are used by players to purchase a variety of items, including decoration items for character or weapon customization. A rotating "event mode" was added to the game around March 2016. These events change the rules of normal play, such as the placement of large teams or squads, or the distribution of weapons and armor throughout the game map.
