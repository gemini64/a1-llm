Education is the process of learning new things. People learn skills, knowledge, and ideas that help them understand the world and improve their lives. Education can happen in schools, at home, or anywhere people share and gain knowledge. (*)

Levels

Primary Education
This is the first stage of education. It usually starts when children are about 5 to 7 years old. In primary school, kids learn basic skills like reading, writing, and math.

Secondary Education
After primary school, students go to secondary school. Here, they learn more complex subjects like science, history, and languages.

Higher Education
After secondary school, some people go to college or university. Here, they study specific subjects and train for jobs they want in the future.

Types
There are different kinds of education:

Formal Education: This happens in schools, colleges, and universities. It has a set structure, with teachers, subjects, and tests. People go to school to learn how to read, write, and solve problems.



Informal Education: This happens outside of school. It includes learning from family, friends, or even the internet. For example, learning how to cook from your parents or learning to ride a bike.



Non-formal Education: This is planned learning but doesn't happen in a school. It can be activities like learning to play a sport, attending a workshop, or taking an art class.
