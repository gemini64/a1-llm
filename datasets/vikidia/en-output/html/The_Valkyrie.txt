Set design for Act I, 1876 production
The Valkyrie (German:Die Walküre) is an opera with words and music by Richard Wagner. The story of the opera is based on the Norse mythology told in the Volsunga Saga and the Poetic Edda.
The Valkyrie is the second opera in Wagner's cycle of operas called The Ring of the Nibelung. The four operas in the cycle are The Rhine Gold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried, and Twilight of the Gods.
The Valkyrie was first performed against Wagner's wishes at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater in Munich on 26 June 1870. Wagner was forced to allow the performance at the insistence of his patron King Ludwig II of Bavaria.
The opera later received its official premiere as part of the complete Ring cycle on 14 August 1876, in the Bayreuther Festspielhaus. Musical highlights include the "Spring Song", "The Ride of the Valkyries" and the "Magic Fire Music".
