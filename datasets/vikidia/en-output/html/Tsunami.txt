The tsunami of 2004
A tsunami is a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of water.

Causes
Tsunamis result from submarine earthquakes or other events that involve a large displacement of water such as landslides or volcanic eruptions.
Tsunamis do not have anything to do with the tides.

How it looks like
Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning harbour (tsu) wave (nami).
A tsunami is not just one wave but a series of waves or a “wave train”. When tsunamis approach the coast, they slow down but increase in height. When an ocean begins to recede dramatically at the beach, it most likely means that a tsunami is very near and huge waves will arrive in a few seconds or minutes.
Animals can sense a tsunami approaching because of their superior sense of hearing. People who have survived tsunamis say that it sounds like standing near a moving freight train.
