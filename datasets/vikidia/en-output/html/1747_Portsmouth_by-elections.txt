The 1747 Portsmouth by-elections were two by-elections held in the British Parliament constituency of Portsmouth on 15 December 1747 and 28 December 1747.
The first election took place on 15 December 1747, when the incumbent Thomas Gore chose to sit for Bedford. Edward Legge was elected as MP for Portsmouth despite the fact he had died in the West Indies 87 days prior.
As the first election was void due to Legge being dead, a second election was held on 28 December 1747 after news of his death had arrived. In the second election, Sir Edward Hawke was elected.
Hawke served as MP for Portsmouth until 1776.
