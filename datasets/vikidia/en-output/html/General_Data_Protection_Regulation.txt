General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new europ√©an settlement about private data (name, number of phone, mail...).  This gives companies obligations on the use and safety of data. For example, if a database of a firm is hacked, the firm is obligated to inform people. Also, the firm must be able to prove the security of their data storage system. This regulation is valid since May 2018.
