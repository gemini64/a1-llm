Giant panda eating bamboo
An endangered species is any mammal, insect, fish, plant, or other living creature that is threatened with extinction or its survival is very uncertain.
A bird called the dodo was made extinct in the middle of the 17th century. It was unable to fly and lived on an island in the Indian Ocean. The sailors on ships that passed the island went ashore. They killed many of the birds for food.
In modern times, there are many animals and plants threatened with extinction such as the giant panda and Baker's larkspur. People in modern days have taken action. Lists are kept of animals and plants threatened with extinction, creatures are studied, and this makes it possible for humans to make an attempt to assure the survival of the threatened species.
