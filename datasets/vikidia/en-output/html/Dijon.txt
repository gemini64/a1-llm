Regional metropolis

At the very center of the economic and touristic triangle of Paris, Lyon and Strasboug, the city of Dijon has kept its own character and quality of life.

History

Dijon was home to the Dukes of Burgundy for five centuries during the Middle Ages and it has retained a great number of half-timbered houses as well as Burgundian polychrome roofs made of coloured tiles glazed in terracotta, arranged in geometric patterns.
In the 19th century, mainly starting with the Second Empire (1852-1870), Dijon was hit by Industrial revolution, thanks to the railway network. The street plan and the water supply system were modernized, in the same way as in Haussmann's Paris. Several buildings in the Art Nouveau style were preserved as a historical heritage.
