PlayStation 1
The PlayStation (abbreviated as PS, commonly known as the PS1/PS one or its codename PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Sony's PlayStation has won over the loyalty of millions of gamers worldwide, and industry experts cite its video game content library as one of the primary reasons why. The original PlayStation continued production until March 2005, when it was eclipsed by the next generation of 64-bit consoles, including Sony's own PlayStation 2 (PS2; introduced in the early 2000s).
