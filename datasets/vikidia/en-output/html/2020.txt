2020 (MMXX) was a leap year starting on Wednesday in the 21st century. It was a very turbulent time for many, mainly because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 (or coronavirus) pandemic. The pandemic caused by this virus had led to multiple lockdowns. Businesses and schools closed around the world. The pandemic has been likened to the black death/plague pandemic in the 13th to 16th centuries. Other notable events include: actor Chadwick Boseman's death in August, the George Floyd protests started in June, the Impeachment of 45th President Donald Trump, basketball star Kobe Bryant's death in January, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quitting the royal family, Australian bushfires, "Parasite" sweeps the Oscars, Harvey Weinstein's verdict, the Stock market crash, and Joe Biden becomes Democratic presidential nominee.
2020 was also the start of a new decade, it was preceded by 2019 and followed by 2021.
