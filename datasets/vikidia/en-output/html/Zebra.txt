Zebra

The zebra is a mammal. It is a member of the horse family. It has black and white stripes.
Zebras live in African grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains, and coastal hills. Zebras eat mostly grasses, but sometimes they eat leaves, twigs, bark, and shrubs.
They live in small groups or large herds. The female zebra usually has her first baby when she is three. In the western world, zebras are kept in zoos and circuses. They are not easily tamed.
The greatest threat to the zebra's survival is hunting the animal for its skin and meat, and turning its wild living places into farms.

Bhaviour
Zebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Gr√©vy's zebras make mule-like brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly. (*)
