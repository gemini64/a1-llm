Tubman about 1885
Harriet Tubman was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. She was born Araminta Ross about 1822 in Maryland. She died on March 10, 1913 in Auburn, New York.
Tubman was born a slave in Maryland, but escaped. She subsequently made about thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad.
She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.
