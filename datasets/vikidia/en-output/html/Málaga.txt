Hisotry
Málaga is an old city, dating from the 8th centrury BC, when it was founded as a Phoenician colony, at that time known as Malaka. After the Punic Wars, Romans took over the city. A Roman theatre was built in the city. Once the Roman Empire fell down, several Germanic tribes ruled the city, noteworthy the Visigoths. In an attempt to rebuild the Empire, emperor Justinian I conquered the city. From 550 to 621, Málaga was part of the Byzantine Empire, but Visigoths finally took control of the city again. This situation remained until the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by moors, who vanquished the former settlers.
