Macconago Castle (Castello di Macconago) is a castle defensive of medieval origin in the ancient village of Macconago, a locality in the municipality of Milan near the Prada Foundation, inside the Mirasole Oasis.
The area is a fascinating village in the city of Milan, a few minutes from the city center, immersed in the history of the nobility, with Arabian horses that can be seen in the streets. Nearby are the stud farms of some of the most important stallions in the world entrusted for training by billionaires such as the Onassis family.

History
The history of the castle of Macconago dates back to 1030 when a square defensive structure was first erected, completed in 1040 with the construction of a series of watchtowers. The structure was entrusted in castellania to the Pusterla family (whose coats of arms can still be admired today at the two main entrances on the front and back), which however fell out of favor with the Visconti, who definitively requisitioned the castle, later entrusted to the Vimercati family, then passing to the Calchi family, the Marliani, the Ferrario, the Tarlaini, the Greppi and the Gavanas, current owners of the structure.

Structure
The structure of the castle, with the typical square plan, has watchtowers and embattled walkways that have also undergone various transformations and extensions over the centuries. The castle is organized on three floors, of which the only original from the fourteenth century is in the basement, being the one less altered by subsequent interventions.
Inside, the structure retains traces of Renaissance-era graffiti. On the ground floor there are also some period stables. In front of the castle there is also a church dating back to the 18th century.
