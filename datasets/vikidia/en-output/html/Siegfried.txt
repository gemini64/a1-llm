Siegfried holds his father's sword, Nothung.
Siegfried is an opera. The words and music were written by Richard Wagner. It is the third of the four operas that comprise Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung. Siegfried is loosely based on the tale of the hero Sigurd in Norse mythology.
Siegfried was first performed as part of the  premiere performance of The Ring at the Bayreuther Festspielhaus in Germany on 16 August 1876.

Background
Wagner started work on the Ring in 1848, and completed the cycle in 1874. By 1850, he had completed the text for Siegfried's Death. This opera would become the fourth and last in the cycle. It would be retitled Twilight of the Gods.
Wagner decided to expand Siegfried's Death by telling the story of Siegfried's youth. This retelling became another opera, Siegfried.
Wagner then decided to tell the story of Siegfried's conception in The Valkyrie. He completed the cycle with the events leading to Siegfried's conception and the downfall of the gods  in The Rhine Gold.
The cycle in performance order is The Rhine Gold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried, and Twilight of the Gods.
