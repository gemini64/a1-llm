A grandfather is a grandparent, they are your mother's father ("maternal grandfather") or your father's father ("paternal grandfather").
The female equivalent is grandmother.
A grandfather's father is called a great grandfather, their father is a "great great grandfather", and their father is a "great great great grandfather" and their father is a "great great great great grandfather" and so on.
However, numbers are usually used to refer to great grandfathers after a few generations, for example 4th great grandfather rather than "great great great great grandfather".
