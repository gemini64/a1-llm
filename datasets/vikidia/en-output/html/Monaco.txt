The location of Monaco.
Monaco is a tiny country (the second smallest in the world) located in southern Europe. It shares a border only with France. The capital city is Monte Carlo. Monaco is not part of the European Union but it has a very close relationship with European countries and uses the Euro as its currency.

History
The Grimaldi family has ruled over Monaco since 1297 and the state's sovereignty, or right to self-govern, was officially recognized by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. Despite being independent, Monaco's defense is still the responsibility of France.

Geography
Monaco is the smallest French-speaking country in the world. It had a total area of 1.95 square kilometres but after expansion into the sea its area is now 2.05 km². Monaco is noted for its beautiful, hilly, rugged, and rocky natural scenery and its sunny Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.
Because of Monaco's small size there are no mountains or lakes within the country. The highest point is 163 metres on the southern slopes of Mont Agel, although the highest parts of this mountain are located in France.
