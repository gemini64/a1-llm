Friendship is a relationship between two or more people who have great appreciation for each other, share good times, and help each other through difficulties. Family and romantic relationships are normally excluded from this concept.
It is often said that you know who your friends are in adversity, which means that a true friend is one who is willing to help us when we go through a bad time.
