Texas is a large state, including the area north of the Rio Grande border with Mexico, and the southern Great Plains.  Its border is along the Rio Grande, the Gulf of Mexico (up to the Louisiana border), along the Louisiana border and a small part of the Arkansas border to the Red River, which is also the border with Oklahoma.  Its panhandle, which sticks into the north, also borders Oklahoma on its east and north and New Mexico on its west, New Mexico marking the west border of Texas.
Texas was once its own country, though it later became a state after the U.S. Civil War.
