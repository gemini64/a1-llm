Young child with Christmas stocking
A Christmas stocking is a real or ornamental stocking hung up on a bedpost or somewhere near the Christmas Tree by children on Christmas Eve for Santa Claus or Father Christmas to fill with little presents, coins, and candy. In some places, the child's shoes (rather than a stocking) are used for the same purpose.
