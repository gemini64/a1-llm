Infinity is the property of something limitless.
It is represented by the symbol \infty, introduced in the 17th century by the English mathematician John Wallis.
The word "infinity" comes from Latin infinitas, meaning “boundless”. In the sentence “There is no more than X apples in this bag”, if one can't replace X with any fixed number (even immensely large), then the bag contains an infinite collection of apples.
Various fields study infinity or its consequences: mathematics of course (where it is best understood), but also physics and philosophy.
Mathematically speaking, infinity is generally related to sets (the formal concept of a bag) in what is called the set theory. Let S be a set: S is infinite if (and only if):

there is a strict subset T of S (i.e. T contains some, but not all, of the elements that S contains, and T does not contain any element that is not in S);
there is a bijection between S and T (i.e. a way to associate every element in S to a distinct element in T).
