The Libertarian Party (LP) is a political party in the United States that wants a smaller government.
In August 1971, the party was thought of at meetings in David F. Nolan's home in Westminster, Colorado. It was officially formed on 11 December 1971, and was inspired by the works and ideas of Austrian school of economics economist Murray Rothbard.
