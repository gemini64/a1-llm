A typical field thunderstorm
A thunderstorm is a large storm of rain and thunder, and sometimes lightning, hail, and strong winds.
Thunderstorms form from cumulonimbus clouds, moisture, unstable air, and lift. The moisture forms the clouds and rains. The stable air needs to be relatively warm and can rise rapidly. Finally, the lift forms the fronts, sea breezes or mountains.
