Polar bear mother with her cubs in Alaska
The polar bear (scientific name : Ursus maritimus)  is a large bear with white fur. It lives in the icy waters of the Arctic and very cold lands such as Greenland, Siberia, and Alaska. It eats many things, but mostly seals.
Mother bears usually have two cubs. Cubs stay with their mothers for about two and a half years. Polar bears usually live about 25 years.
The polar bear is an endangered species. Temperature changes are melting the ice in areas where the bears live, threatening the survival of this animal.
