Hephaestus  was the Greek god of fire and blacksmiths. The ancient Romans called him Vulcan.
His name sounds like hih FESS tuss. It is sometimes spelled Hephaistos.
People believed that volcanoes were the fires of his forges.
This god probably started as a minor fire god in Asian myths.
In Greek mythology he was the son of Zeus and Hera. They threw him out of Mount Olympus. His wife was the goddess Aphrodite.
He is shown in pictures and sculptures with a beard and mighty arms and shoulders. He was disabled with a deformed foot which made him lame.
