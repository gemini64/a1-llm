A mosquito biting a human
A mosquito is an insect that bites the skin of other animals (including humans) with its mouth parts. The mosquito needs blood to fertilize its eggs. Only the females of some species bite; the others feed, mainly, on plant sap.
While biting its victim, a mosquito injects saliva into the wound. This causes itching and a small bump on the skin. Some mosquitos can be dangerous, because they carry diseases, like malaria.
