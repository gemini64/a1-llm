Búri is a figure from Norse mythology, considered the progenitor of the gods. He is the first being in the genealogy of the Aesir gods, though not much is known about him, as he is a relatively obscure figure. His story is found in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century.
According to the mythology, Búri was created when the primeval cow Audhumla licked the salty ice blocks of Ginnungagap (the primordial void). Over the course of three days, as Audhumla licked the ice, Búri gradually emerged: on the first day, his hair was revealed, on the second day, his head, and by the third day, his entire body was uncovered.
Búri is described as tall, powerful, and handsome, but little else is said about him. He fathered a son named Borr, who would go on to marry Bestla, a giantess. Together, Borr and Bestla had three sons: Odin, Vili, and Ve, who played key roles in creating the world and the human race.
Búri’s significance in the mythological tradition lies in his role as the ancestor of the Aesir gods, especially Odin, but he is not involved in any specific myths or stories beyond his role in the divine genealogy.
