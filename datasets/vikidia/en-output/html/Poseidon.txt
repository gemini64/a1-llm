Poseidon on a krater by the Syriskos Painter
Poseidon is the Ancient Greek god of the oceans. He was renamed Neptune when the Ancient Romans hijacked the Greek Pantheon. He is the god of earthquakes and the god of taming horses, and brother to Zeus and Hades.
His symbols are the trident, the fish, the dolphin, the horse, and the bull. His consort was Amphitrite. His children were Theseus, Triton, Polyphemus, Belus, Agenor, Neleus, and Atlas.
