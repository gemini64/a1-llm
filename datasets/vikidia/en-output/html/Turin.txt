History

The history of Turin started in the 2nd century Before Christ, when on the banks of the river Po, the first Celtic tribe settled, looking for arable plains. These tribes were called Taurisc: hence the word "Torino" and the nickname "city of the tauri (latin for bulls)".
It became a Roman city in 28 B.C. under the name of Augusta Taurinorum. In those times, it was a military centre surrounded by walls and with a square plant. After the fall of the Roman empire, it passed under the control of the Ostrogoths, the Lombards and the Franks. This is one of the darkest historical periods of the city.
In the XV century it became the capital of Savoy; this contributed to its expansion.
In the 17th century, the city widened by buying Montferrat, which allowed to have an outlet to the sea.
In 1706, French troops besieged Turin: the siege was interrupted by the arrival of the Austrian soldiers.
In 19th century, Turin was the centre of the Italian Risorgimento with Vittorio Emmanuele II, King of the Savoy dynasty, Camillo Benso Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, men who managed to unify Italy. Thus, in 1861, Turin became the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy (which lasted until 1865).
