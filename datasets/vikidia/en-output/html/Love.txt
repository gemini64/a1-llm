Symbol of love.
Love is when you like someone, very intensely.
There are different types of love relationships: the relationships between a boyfriend and girlfriend couple (love relation), the relations between parents and children, and between brothers and sisters.
Friendship can be seen as a kind of love, because it is also to feel close to someone, but not with the same intensity.
