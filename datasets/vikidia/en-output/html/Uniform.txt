A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer
A uniform is an article or articles of clothing usually used while working or attending a school. (*)  Uniforms identify members of a group from the general population. Uniforms may be provided or purchased by members. Uniforms often have special emblems showing rank or the color of the uniform may show rank or different positions within an organization. Sports teams wear uniforms so they are not confused with another team. Military uniforms are also intended to show who is the enemy and who is a friend. Firefighters, police officers, airline workers and many other groups who serve the public wear uniforms.
The word "uniform" comes from the Latin words “una” (one) and “forma” (form). (*)
