Smørrebrød in Copenhagen
Smørrebrød (Danish: Buttered bread) is a traditional, open-faced sandwich in Denmark.  The dish consists of a slice of buttered sourdough rye bread topped with any ingredients the diner prefers. Toppings include beef, eel, herring, tomato slices, cucumber slices, boiled eggs, remoulade sauce, mayonnaise, and many other ingredients. The toppings are arranged in an artful and appetizing way, and finished with a spring of dill or parsley. Sandwich shops abound in large cities. It is usual when eating Smørrebrød whether at home or in a cafe, to use a knife and fork, because picking them up to eat can prove both difficult and messy.
