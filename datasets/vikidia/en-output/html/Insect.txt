Insects are usually small animals, with three pairs of legs. They should not be confused with their relatives, the other arthropods, including spiders and centipedes, which can have a different number of legs.
An insect's body is divided into three parts: the head, the thorax and the abdomen. The legs are located on the thorax, which usually also bears two pairs of wings. This may vary with the species.
