ADHD (short for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a brain development disorder which makes it harder for people to focus. It has three types (H, I, and C). In type H, people have hyperactivity meaning they have more energy than neurotypical people. In type I, people are more inattentive meaning they have less energy than neurotypical people. In type C, people are sometimes inattentive and sometimes hyperactive.
