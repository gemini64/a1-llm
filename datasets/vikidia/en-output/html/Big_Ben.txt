The Clock Tower, known as Big Ben
Big Ben is the nickname of a bell that rings in the clock tower at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament of Westminster, London, England. The tower itself is called the Elizabeth Tower in honor of Elizabeth II. Most people call the tower "Big Ben", because it is very large. It weighs 13 tons. It was built by Sir Adam Jonas from Norfolk, England in 1858 by his team of architects and builders.
