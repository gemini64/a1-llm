Bob Ross (born Robert Norman Rose, October 29, 1942 â€” July 4, 1995) was an American artist, painter and television personality, best known for his 1983 PBS TV show The Joy of Painting.  His work on the show involved him painting pictures of landscapes, while explaining how he painted them.  His show always included a list of the colors he was going to use during each particular program.
Sometimes people would paint along with him at home while they were watching.  Occasionally they'd send photographs of their paintings to him.  "The Joy of Painting" was made by the PBS member station WIPB, based in Muncie, Indiana, and ran on PBS until 1994.  It is still shown around the world today.
Bob Ross died on Independence Day 1995, at the age of 52, from a type of cancer called Lymphoma.
