Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking island de facto (in fact). Legally it is bilingual, meaning that both the Spanish and English are official languages, Spanish being the language spoken by the majority of the population.

Spanish
The Spanish language in Puerto Rico has peculiarities that distinguish it from other Spanish-speaking countries as in all regions. This is mainly due to the influence of the Canary, Corsican and Catalan to the island during the colonial era and languages of the Tainos and African immigrants. More recently, the English language is felt from the influence derived from the almost exclusive trade with the United States and the large number of Puerto Ricans living on US soil. A strong influence of English is detected in the population and its linguistic culture.

English
English is taught as a second language, although it has been estimated that only 10 to 20 percent of the residents of the island speak English "very well".
