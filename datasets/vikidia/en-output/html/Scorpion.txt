Scorpions (scientific name: Scorpiones) are a group of small invertebrate animals with 8 legs. They are arachnids, like spiders. There are over 2,500 species of scorpion.

Evolution


Scorpions are very ancient animals: the oldest fossils found were around 450 million years old. This means that they appeared twice as long ago as the very first dinosaurs.

Description
Scorpion anatomy:  1 = Cephalothorax;  2 = Abdomen;  3 = Tail;  4 = Claws (pedipalps);  5 = Legs;  6 = Chelicerae;  7 = Pincers;  8 = Moveable claw;  9 = Fixed claw;  10 = Stinger;  11 = Anus;  12 = Opening of respiratory tract (book lungs)
The body of a scorpion is divided into two parts. First, there's the cephaloythorax, with eyes, mouth, chelicerae, 4 pairs of legs and 2 claws. Then there's the abdomen with the tail and the genital, respiratory and sensory organs. The tail ends in a venomous stinger.

Scorpions are covered by a carapace called the cuticle. It fluoresces blue when exposed to UV light.
They can measure from a few millimetres to more than 20 centimetres, like the emperor scorpion.

Venom

Scorpions are well known for the venom they can inject with their stinger. They can use it to kill their prey or defend themselves
All scorpions can sting, but only around fifty of the more than 2.500 species are dangerous to humans. They are mainly found in North America and Africa. However, scorpions are not very aggressive and only sting if they are threatened or disturbed. Fatal accidents are rare, especially among healthy adults.
The deathstalker is considered to be one of the most dangerous scorpions. It is highly unlikely that it could kill an adult, but the most vulnerable people, such as children or the elderly, are much more at risk.
When a person is stung by a scorpion, the medical term used is scorpionism.
It is thought that their venom could be used in medicine, but no conclusive results have yet been obtained.

Behaviour

Diet
Scorpions are predators. Some simply wait for prey to pass near their burrows, while others go in search of it. They generally eat other arachnids and insects. The largest can even eat lizards and small mammals.
They catch their prey between their pincers. The smallest can be crushed, while the toughest or most aggressive are stung.

Breeding

It seems that all scorpions are viviparous, unlike other arachnids which lay eggs.
The number of young depends very much on the species: they may be less than ten or one hundred. When they are born, they are completely white and are unable to attack or defend themselves because they have no pincers and their stinger is not functional. In general, females are good mothers. They carry their young on their backs and protect them until their first moult.

Distribution
Scorpions live on every continent except Antarctica. They are very adaptable animals. They live mainly in deserts and other arid areas, but they can also be found in forests, caves and even at high altitude in the mountains. Although they prefer warm temperatures, they can survive in colder places if necessary.
They live in burrows that they dig themselves.

Relationship with humans

Scorpions are often feared because of their venom. Although deaths from scorpion stings are rare, envenomations are common in some countries and can cause problems.
In some parts of Africa and Asia, scorpions are eaten, usually fried.

Scorpions as a pet
Today, some exotic animals are becoming increasingly popular as pets. This is the case with scorpions, as some are not very venomous, are calm and do not eat much.
As a result of the trade in exotic pets, some scorpion species have become rare and endangered, such as the emperor scorpion.
