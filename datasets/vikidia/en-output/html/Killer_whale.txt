The orca whale (scientific name : Orcinus orca) is also known as the killer whale. It is a mammal found in all oceans around the world. It is an apex predator, and has no natural enemy.
Orcas eat a variety of foods, from fish to seals to sea birds to turtles. They hunt in packs, and have been called "the wolves of the sea".
Orcas live in social groups that are composed of members descended from the same mother. These groups are considered some of the most stable animal groups in the world.
Wild orcas pose no threat to humans, though some captive orcas have killed handlers and trainers in water theme parks. Some populations are considered endangered.
