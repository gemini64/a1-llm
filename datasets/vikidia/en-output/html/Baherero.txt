Baherero are an ethnic group living in Southern Africa. Baherero originate from central and southern Namibia. The Baherero in Botswana migrated in the early 1904-1908 due to the Herero and Namaqua genocide committed by the German empire (*) .  Baherero are traditionally pastoralists, they make a living tending livestock. The Herero people take pride in their cattle. They believe that the more cattle one had, the richer one is, making cattle a symbol of wealth. The Baherero belong to two main cultural groups:
• Ovabanderu
• Ovaherero
They speak Otjiherero and Otjibanderu. In Botswana, the Baherero are found in regions such as Toromoja, Mokoboxane, Rakops, Charles Hill and Mahalapye.

Food
As pastoralists, the Overherero rely on livestock for food. Meat is dried for preservation. Common food includes:
•Omaere- made from soul milk.
•Othopa- a porridge made from sorghum.
•Wild fruits such as serowa, serokana, morama and moretlwa.
The Baherero are also skilled hunter-gatherers, collecting indigenous fruits and herbs for sustenance (*) .

Attire
Historically, the Baherero wore animal skin garments (matlalo).However, during the Herero wars, they adopted elements of German military uniforms.
• Men. Some warriors wore the uniforms of defeated German soldiers, believing that by donning these garments, they would inherit the deceased's authority. In order to respect their forefathers and preserve their memories, Herero men now dress in military garments such as gaiters, berets, epaulettes, and peaked caps. This custom has developed into a ceremonial tradition.
• Women. They adopted floor length gowns inspired by German missionary dresses in the late 19th century, now made in vivid colors and prints.
• The Ohorokova dress is worn on special occasions. The dress is identified as a sign of women's shift towards marriage and motherhood, representing the duties of adulthood and women's acceptance of them (*) .
• The Otjikaiva headdress is a signature part of Herero women's fashion.

Celebrations and Traditions
The Baherero hold annual commemorations of the war between the Herero and the Germans (*) . Their cultural customs share some similarities with those of Namibia's Bantu tribes.  Additionally, they carry out customs that some tribes have long forgotten, like otjiramue, which is the marriage of cousins.  While the girls are readied for marriage at an early age to become brides to the males who would eventually marry them, their boys are also circumcised.  Since they are the heads of their households, males are also held in high regard by them both at home and in the community.
• In Mahalapye, the Otjiverando ceremony takes place in August.
• In Toromoja, the Ovabanderu hold their July commemoration.
During the Mantsho-outdooring ceremony, newborns are named by their grandfather at the holy fire (Okuruuo). The names often reflect significant results.
Marriage Traditions:
• Marriages are arranged by the father.
• The bride price (magadi) consists of two cows.
• During weddings and religious ceremonies, cattle are sacrificed.
