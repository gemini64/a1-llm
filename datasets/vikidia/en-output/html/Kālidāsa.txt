Scene from Shakuntala
Kālidāsa was a poet and writer of plays from India.
His name sounds like KAH lee DAH sah.
He probably lived sometime in the 400s. He is thought by some to be the greatest Indian writer in the Sanskrit language.
Many poems and plays are said to be written by him. But experts think only about six are really by him.
The play Abhijñānashākuntala ("The Recognition of Shakuntala") is his best-known work. It is the story of a king who meets and marries the adopted daughter of a wise man.
