God is a figure in many religions. It is worshipped, and sometimes offerings are given to it. God is just an idea, in many religions. There are monotheistic and polytheistic religions, which depend on the god or gods that they have.

Monotheistic religions have just one God, like Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
Polytheistic religions have many gods, like Hinduism.
