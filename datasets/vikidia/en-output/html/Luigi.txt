Luigi's symbol
Luigi is a video game character. He is the younger (and taller) brother of Mario. Luigi first appeared in the 1983 Game & Watch game Mario Bros., where he is the character controlled by the second player. He would retain this role in many future games, including Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, among other titles. He was first available as a primary character in Super Mario Bros. 2. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs, such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series; however, he has been featured in a starring role in Luigi's Hammer Toss, Mario is Missing, Luigi's Mansion, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Dr. Luigi, New Super Luigi U, Luigi's Mansion Arcade, and Luigi's Mansion 3. In most of said games, he is called upon to act as the hero because Mario is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games.
