Pork is the meat which comes from pigs.  Evidence exists which shows that pigs have been raised and used for food for about 7000 years, back to 5000 BCE.  Pork is used to make lots of different foods like Spam, Bacon, Bratwurst and Ham.
Treating Pork in different ways, such as smoking or curing, not only changes the flavour, but also the texture of the meat.  In some countries, like the USA and UK, Pork is the most commonly eaten meat.
Denmark is one of the top 5 exporters of Pork worldwide (as of 2020), taking $3,100,000,000 ($3.1 Billion dollars).  The biggest exporter worldwide is Spain.
