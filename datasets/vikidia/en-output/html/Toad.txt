Common toad
A toad is an amphibian. There are many species. They are known for their dry, leathery skin, short legs, and warts. They are of the order Anura (frogs). A group of toads is called a "knot".
Taxonomists make no distinction between frogs and toads. For many people though, toads are thought to live on land, and frogs are thought to live in water or watery places such as swamps and the edges of ponds.
