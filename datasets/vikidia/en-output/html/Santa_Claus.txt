Santa Claus has a long white beard, and wears a red suit with white trim.
Santa Claus is a fictional Christmas character. He is loosely based on St. Nicholas, the patron saint of children.
Santa Claus is an elf who lives at the North Pole. He makes toys for children. He rides through the sky on Christmas Eve in a sleigh drawn by reindeer. He lands on the roof of a house in his sleigh, then drops down the chimney. He leaves toys for all the children in the house under the Christmas tree and in their Christmas stockings.
Over the years, many customs have grown up around Santa Claus. For instance, children write letters to Santa and mail them to his workshop at the North Pole. They leave cookies and milk for him on Christmas Eve, and carrots for his reindeer. In some places, children go to department stores to tell one of "Santa's helpers" what toys they want for Christmas.
