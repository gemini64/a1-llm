Area is a particular part of a town, a country, a region, or the world. (*)  More specifically, area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape. (*)  In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long. A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.
