A map during war
On 7 October 2023, there was a violent conflict between Palestinian militant groups, primarily led by Hamas, and the Israeli military. (*)  It started with a Hamas attack on southern Israel, followed by Israeli military strikes in the Gaza Strip and a full-scale invasion of Gaza. By the end of October, a significant number of casualties had occurred on both sides, with thousands of people killed, including many children. Additionally, a number of Israelis and foreign nationals were captured or taken as hostages.
The Hamas attack began with thousands of rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel. At the same time, Palestinian militants breached the barrier between Gaza and Israel, causing civilian casualties and attacking Israeli military bases. Many countries, mainly from the Western world, considered this incursion a terrorist attack. Hamas claimed that their attack was in response to various grievances, including the situation around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the blockade of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and settler violence.
