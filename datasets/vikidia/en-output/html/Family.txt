A family is a group of people who all have some relation to each other. This can be by birth, as parent and child, or by law such as marriage or adoption. Very often members of a family live together, especially while the children are too young to live on their own.

Terminology

The sides of the family have names according to the parent. Relatives on the mother's side are on the "maternal" side, and on the father's side are the "paternal" side. The mother's parents are a child's maternal grandparents, and the father's parents are the paternal grandparents.



A first cousin is the child of your parent's brother or sister.



In-laws are people related through marriage. The spouse's parents are the "mother-in-law" and "father-in-law" while the siblings of a spouse are the other's "brother-in-law" and "sister-in-law."
