Radio is a way to send information over a long distance. It is used to deliver facts from one place to another. A machine that sends radio signals is called a transmitter. A machine that "picks up" the signals is called a receiver. (A machine that does both jobs is called a "transceiver".) When radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a broadcast. Television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound.
