Samba deer are large animals that live in parts of Asia and Africa . The scientific name of the samba deer is Rusa unicolor.
They have short light brown hair, but males sometimes have dark brown hair. And their tail is quite long for deers.
They sleep during the day, and are awake at night. In India the population of samba deer exceeds 50,000 individuals, and in Australia sambars number more than 5,000. A big problem for the sambar is that they are endangered because they are hunted by humans and other animals. They are herbivores so they eat things like grasses, foliage, fruit , leaves, berries, bark, and shrubs.
Samba deer can be pregnant with one baby fawn at a time, and their pregnancy lasts 9 months. Once they are 27 to 35 days old the baby fawn start ruminating and they stay with their mothers for approximately 2 years. Sambar are nocturnal or crepuscular animals and rest during the day under the cover of heavy forest .
The males live alone for much of the year, and the females live in small herds of up to 16 individuals.
