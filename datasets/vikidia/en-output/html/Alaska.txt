Alaska is one of the two states (the other is Hawaii) that is not in the contiguous United States, the 48 states in the mainland of the United States. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, Canada (Yukon and British Columbia) to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the south.
Alaska is separated to the west from Russia by the Bering Strait. The strait is approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide. It was acquired by the US on March 30, 1867 from the Russian Empire. This event is referred to as the Alaska Purchase.
