Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF), is a media franchise created, designed, developed and published by Scott Cawthon.

Elements

Security cameras
Sercurity cameras are probably the most important element in the game. With them, the player can determine the position of the robots and thus facilitate the game. Only one camera can be viewed at a time. In each game, some camera spice is added (eg in FNaF 1 the screen on Cam 6 is not visible, but sound can be heard, in FNaF 3 a shaft system is added ...).

Lights
With the lights, the player can check if any of the robots are near him (in the hallway, in front of the door, in the shaft ...) to take timely action. In FNaF 2, a competitor must focus on the camera if he wants to see various details on it.

Jumpscares
Jumpscares (Fig. Scary jump) is an element of the game where it ends. Jumpscare happens when one of the robots unexpectedly appears on the screen and emits a sound that is different in each game. Each robot has its own jumscare and no two robots have the same. When jumpscare happens, the player is usually intimidated and the game ends.

Phone calls
Phone calls happen at the start of each new night. The playerâ€™s calls in the first nights teach him how to play, but later they are getting shorter and less telling. These phone calls were allegedly sent by a previous night security guard. In FNaF: Sister Location, the compensation for a phone call is a computer voice that guides the player through the game.

Doors
The door is an element that prevents robots from entering the room. When the player shines a light and sees a robot nearby, he closes the door and the robot will walk away over time. In FNaF 2, the door was replaced with a Freddy Fazbear mask. This mask misleads most robots that the player is one of them and so they walk away.
