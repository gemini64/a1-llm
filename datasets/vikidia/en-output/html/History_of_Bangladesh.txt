Flag of Bangladesh
Bangladesh is a populous and developing country in South Asia. The country emerged as an independent state on the world map after gaining independence from Pakistan in the 1971 War of Independence.
First came Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in the 1204th century. At this time, he occupied Nadia in the west of Bengal and some parts of North Bengal. However, he died in the Bihar campaign in 1206.
The history of the civilization of Bangladesh has been going on for more than four millennia since the Chalcolithic period. The country's early history is of conflict and competition between Hindu and Buddhist empires for regional supremacy.
Islam came to this region in the sixth to seventh century. Islam gradually became the dominant religion in the country through the military conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khilji in the early thirteenth century, as well as the relentless efforts of Sunni days like Shah Jalal. Later, Muslim rulers contributed to the spread of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century, the region Shahi Bengal ruled the area as Shahi Bengal accelerating the country's economic prosperity and establishing military dominance over regional empires. Europeans then referred to Shahi Bengal as the most prosperous country for trade. The region later came under the Mughal Empire and was considered the wealthiest province of the Mughal Empire. Bengal Subah produced about half of the GDP of the entire Mughal Empire and 12% of the world GDP, more than Western Europe's. This economic prosperity ushered in the early industrialization period. At that time, the population of the capital city of Dhaka exceeded one million.
After the fall of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century, Bengal became a semi-autonomous rastra under the Nawabs, whose rule was eventually vested in Nawab Sirajuddaula. Then, in 1757, the British East India Company captured the region by winning the Battle of Palashi. Bengal directly contributed to Britain's industrial revolution but destroyed its industrialization. Later, the Bengal Presidency was established.
The borders of modern Bangladesh were established by the separation of Bengal and India in August 1947, when the end of British rule in the subcontinent resulted in the region becoming East Pakistan as part of the newly formed state of Pakistan.
After declaring independence in March 1971, East Pakistan emerged as the People's Republic of Bangladesh by winning a bloody nine-month war of independence against West Pakistan. After independence, the new state faced numerous problems, including famine, natural disasters, widespread poverty, political unrest and military coups. After restoring democracy in 1991, relative peace was established in the country, and rapid economic progress began. Bangladesh has become the second top economic power in South Asia through the progress in human resources and the garment industry, and it has created wonder throughout the world.
