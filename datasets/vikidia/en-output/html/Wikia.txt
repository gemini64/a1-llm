Wikia's logo
Wikia is a free wiki hosting site (called a wiki farm). The site was founded in 2004 by Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley. The site was called Wikicities until 2006 when it was changed to Wikia to avoid confusion with actual cities. According to Wikia, it has over 400,000 wiki communities. (*)
Wikia uses a modified version of MediaWiki. All wikis are published with a free license. It hosts wikis about many different topics, such as games, movies, music, books, lifestyle, etc. Some of the most well-known include Wookieepedia (Star Wars), Memory Alpha (Star Trek),and formerly Uncyclopedia (a parody of Wikipedia) and the infamous creepypasta Wikia.
Wikia does not currently offer private wikis.
In 2016, Wikia changed its name again to FANDOM, and also changed the URL domain to fandom.com. (*)
