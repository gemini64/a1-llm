Hepburn as Jo in the 1933 movie version of the novel
Little Women is a realistic coming of age novel by Louisa May Alcott. The novel was originally published in two volumes (Little Women in 1868 and Good Wives in 1869) before being published as a single volume in 1880. Alcott followed the novel with two sequels: Little Men and Jo's Boys. All three books were huge successes.
The story is about the four young March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—and their lives in a rural New England town during the American Civil War. The girls' lives become complicated by the handsome boy next door, Laurie. He loves Jo, but marries Amy.
The novel has been made into movies several times, notably with Katherine Hepburn playing Jo in the 1933, and June Allyson playing the same character in the 1949. The story has also been made into an opera.
