Black widow spider
Latrodectus is a genus of spiders found around the world. There are many species. The most famous species is the black widow spider. Its bite can be deadly. The spider is well known for the red "hourglass" found on the abdomen of most species. The spider nests and builds its webs in woodpiles, attics, and debris. The female of some species kills and eats its mate. This habit has led to the spider being called "the widow spider". Great caution should be exercised around areas where it may nest.
