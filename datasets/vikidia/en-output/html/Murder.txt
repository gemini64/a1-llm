Murder is when one person deliberately ends another person's life. It is a usually a criminal act. If someone kills someone accidentally, it is not called murder, but manslaughter. Occasionally, a death caused by someone deliberately may not be murder â€” this can happen if someone is being hurt or attacked, and they do something which causes the person attacking or hurting them to die - this is called self defence. It is usually the job of a coroner to decide whether a person was murdered or if their death came about in another way.
