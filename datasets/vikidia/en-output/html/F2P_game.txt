A free to play game (F2P) is a game where the game is free but usually there are premium stuff in the game. This is how the group makes money. This is rare in console games but in mobile games, it is very common. The premium stuff in the game often helps a player with a game, therefore less skill. People who play the game entirely free often get more skill because they may not have items that helps them. While people who pay for such items often get less skill because the item helps them.

Methods


The 2 in game currencies method

One of the most common types of F2Ps are the 2 in game currency method. The main currency (Ex: Coins) are common throughout the game and helpful for minor items and so. They will be seen literally everywhere in the game usually. However, The 2nd currency (Ex: Stars) is much rarer and it usually costs money for it. Otherwise, premium currency can be found at the start, or by rare stuff like achievements.

Free mode and premium mode

Games like Prodigy math game. They have a free version often with simpler stuff and less features, the premium version offers the full version, with all of the features. This can cause extreme opinions on people who cannot pay or afford to pay.
