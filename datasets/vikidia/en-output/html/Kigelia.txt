The Sausage Tree (scientific name: Kigelia Africana) is a type of tree that grows in South Africa.  (*)  The tree is very poisonous to eat. Sausage trees are fast-growing in the right conditions and can reach 50 feet in height.  (*)
Kigelia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae.  (*)  The genus consists of only one species, Kigelia africana, which occurs throughout tropical Africa, from Eritrea and Chad south to northern South Africa, and west to Senegal and Namibia.  (*)  Common in India, with many medicinal uses, the species' distribution is most certainly anthropogenic. The sausage tree grows a fruit that is up to 60 cm (2 feet) long, weighs about 7 kg (15 pounds), and looks like a sausage.  (*)
