Mike Hoffman is an ice hockey player. He plays for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey Leauge.

Career history

He was drafted by the Ottawa Senators with the 130th pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.

Controversy and trade

Former teammate Erik Karlsson and his wife Melinda said that Mike's girlfriend Monika had been bullying them on the internet. They said that they wrote thousands of comments online over a period of a few months, including a comment joking about how their son Axel had died before his birth, and had also wrote comments wishing Melinda and her son dead, and wishing that Erik would suffer a career ending injury.
Although it has not been proven that she wrote the comments, after this became public news the Senators decided the best course of action was to trade him out of Ottawa. He was traded to the San Jose Sharks alongside Cody Donaghey and a fifth-round pick of the 2020 NHL Entry Draft for a sixth round pick in that draft, Mikkel Boedker and Julius Bergman, but was later traded to the Florida Panthers for 2 picks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft and another in the 2019 Draft.
