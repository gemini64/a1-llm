The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of the Government of the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister is usually elected by a General Election which takes place every 5 years, although sometimes the job can be given to someone else part way between elections, usually this happens for example, if the current Prime Minister resigns. In this case, it's up to the members of the political party to which they belong, to select who they want to take over. Whoever leads the political party in power, automatically becomes the Prime Minister (although The King still has to give his formal permission for them to take up the job.)
The current prime minister is Keir Starmer who was elected in the 2024 general election.
The first British prime minister and the longest-serving British prime minister is Sir Robert Walpole, who was prime minister of the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1721 till 1742.
William Pitt the Younger was the first prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with its creation on 1 January 1801. Benjamin Disraeli was the first prime minister to use the title in an official act when he signed the 1878 Treaty of Berlin as "Prime Minister of Her Birtannic Majesty".
In 1905, the post of prime minister was given official recognition in the order of precedence, with Henry Campbell-Bannerman the first officially referred to as "prime minister".
The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland upon its creation in 1922 (when 26 Irish counties seceded and created the Irish Free State). Although the country was not officially renamed until 1927, when Stanley Baldwin was prime minister.
The official residence of the Prime Minister is 10 Downing Street, London SW1A 2AA. It has been used officially since 1735.
