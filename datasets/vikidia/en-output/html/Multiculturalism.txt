Multiculturalism is when several cultures exist together in a given territory or society, each maintaining own characteristics over time.
For multiculturalism to be maintained, policies may encourage people to respect all the cultures or even promote diversity.
Multiculturalism is not the only way how cultures may interact within a territory or society. Other ways to interact are:

interculturalism, where policies promote a reduced set of common elements or values,
assimilation into a dominant culture (one culture is considered as the norm for that territory or society),
segregation, where people of different cultures must perform some activities separately.
