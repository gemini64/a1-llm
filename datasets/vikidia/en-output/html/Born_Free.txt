Story
George and Joy Adamson live in Kenya, and raise three orphaned lion cubs to young lionhood. Two are sent to a Rotterdam zoo, but Elsa, the third lion, remains with Joy.
Elsa is accused of stampeding a herd of elephants through a village. Authorities tell Joy to return Elsa to the wild or send her to a zoo. Joy succeeds in rehabilitating Elsa, and releases her to the wild.
The Adamsons return to England for a year, then return to Kenya for a week. They hope to find Elsa. They do, and Elsa has not forgotten them. The Adamsons are thrilled to discover Elsa is the mother of three cubs.
