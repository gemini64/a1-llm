War is an armed conflict between armies or militias of two or more nations or countries. It may include numerous battles, organized into campaigns. A war ends either when one side surrenders (lays down its arms) or the sides negotiate a truce through diplomacy.
Many people are the casualties of war, either killed or wounded. This includes fighters, called "soldiers" or "troops," and civilians, who are "non-combatants." Targeting civilians is a "war crime." Some weapons of war, such as artillery, tanks, and naval and aerial bombardment, can cause much damage to buildings where people live and work.
War is a reason many people flee a conflict zone and become refugees.
