The diaphragm is an involuntary muscle that looks like a dome. It's located between the chest cavity and the abdominal cavity. It is composed of a big tendon, called the Phrenic centre. From this tendon, different sets of muscle sheafs start that are connected to the breastbone, lumbar vertebras and ribs.

Functions
The diaphragm is one of the fundamental organs of breathing: when it tenses, it lifts the diaphragmatic dome, which permits the tensing and the expansion of the lungs.
The diaphragm is among the principal muscles for respiraton: contracting makes it lower the diaphragmatic dome that together with the raising of the chest, caused by the intercostal muscles, it allows the expansion and the contraction of the diaphragm, necessary for respiraton.

The Phrenic centre
The Phrenic centre, also called tendon centre, has the shape of a clover,  so it can separate into 3 sections: the right leaf, the centre and the left leaf. The posterior (back) of this tendon is attached to the Vertebrae, the anterior (front) is attached to the breastbone.
The Phrenic centre is also crossed, the centre leaf is combined with the Right Vena cava.
