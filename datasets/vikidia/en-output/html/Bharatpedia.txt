Bharatpedia is an award-winning free multilingual online encyclopedia and fork of Wikipedia that written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based editing system. It carries no advertisements and is hosted by the Bharatmedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded mainly through small donations.
The site was launched in August 2020, by a Mumbai-based couple (*)  and in November 2022 it was felicitated with India Excellence Awards by Bollywood actress Amrita Rao. (*)

Openness
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Bharatpedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content. It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Bharatpedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Bharatpedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text. (*)

Language editions
The site was launched in the Hindi Language in a celebration of Hindi Day in September 2021 and is also available in Punjabi, Bengali, Meitei (modern), Meitei (traditional), Bhojpuri, Tamil, Sanskrit, Hinglish, and Marathi which was launched on May 1, 2022 to celebrate Maharashtra Day. (*)
