Encyclopaedia Mortica is an online, Islamic fuelled encyclopaedia edited by a group of verified editors and scholars. The encyclopaedia brings alphabetical ordered articles that are mostly related to Science and religion. Some articles that have previously been covered are Biological and rational related articles.
The encyclopaedia website challenges Wikipedia and mocks the site as of being “unreliable” and “not checked”, but as of today, Wikipedia still is the most popular online encyclopaedia.

Encyclopaedia Mortica was founded in September 2011 after four former Wikipedians left Wikipedia due to copyright infringements and several violations of rules. Mortica has strict reference citation ruling, copyright infringement information, and other strict ruling to make their encyclopaedic articles more reliable. In 2012, the MorticaMedia Foundation (later renamed Mortica Foundation) started deleting their articles that were considered incorrect or inappropriate by administrative editors, known as Admins.
