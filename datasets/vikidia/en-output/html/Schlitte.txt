A schlitte is a type of large and lightweight sled typically made of wood and used in certain wooded areas of Europe.
When the sled is not loaded, its driver can easily carry it to the top of the mountain. Once there, it is loaded with logs and rolled downhill through a ramp made of several wooden steps placed in parallel.
