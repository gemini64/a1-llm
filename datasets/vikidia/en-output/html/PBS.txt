The Public Broadcasting Service, better known as PBS, is a broadcasting service based in Arlington, Virginia, USA.  It is a not-for-profit service, meaning that its existence relies entirely on public donations.  It does not show any commercials at all.  The PBS is made up of a group of different broadcasters across the US, whose own programming contributes to PBS's output.  There are more than 100 of these member stations, spread across all 50 states of the USA, as well as territories such as Guam and the Virgin Islands.
PBS is known across the US for being responsible for the popularity of some of America's greatest celebrities, such as the chefs Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, the entertainer Fred Rogers and the artist Bob Ross.  It was also the first station to nationally broadcast Sesame Street.
