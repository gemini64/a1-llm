Bacchus was the Roman god of agriculture, wine, festivals/parties, madness, and merriment. It is equivalent to the Greeks god Dionysus.
Bacchus was the son of Jupiter and Semele. He was the only son of his mother, who also had only one husband. However, his father had 5 wives so Bacchus had 4 half-brothers, Mercury, Mars, Vulcan, and Apollo, as well as 5 half-sisters, Venus, Juventia, Minerva, Proserpina, and Diana.
