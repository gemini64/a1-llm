Map showing the location of Cyprus in Europe and western Asia
Cyprus is an island nation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Technically Cyprus is located in Asia but it is often considered to be culturally and politically a part of Europe and it has been in the European Union since 2004. Cyprus is a divided island but only the Republic of Cyprus is internationally recognized. The northern part of Cyprus is known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and is only recognized by Turkey. As the division is not internationally recognized this means that all citizens of the island of Cyprus are members of the European Union. The capital city is Nicosia and the unrecognised capital of northern Cyprus is also Nicosia (known as Lefkoşa in Turkish). The currency of Cyprus is the Euro.

History of Cyprus

A former British colony, it gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1960 and became a Commonwealth republic in 1961. The Republic of Cyprus is a developed country and has been a member of the European Union since May 1, 2004.
People have lived in Cyprus since before 10,000 BCE. Early settlers came from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa and later from Greece. It was later part of the Byzantine Empire for over 800 years followed by the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Between 1963 and 1974 there was a lot of violence in Cyprus between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The violence was in some ways encouraged by Greece and Turkey. After Greece overthrew the government in 1974 more serious fighting broke out and the country has been divided between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots ever since.
