Tasmanian devil
The Tasmanian devil (scientific name : Sarcophilus harrisii) is an animal of the Australian island state of Tasmania. It is a marsupial. This means the animal raises its young in a pouch on the mother's tummy.  The Tasmanian devil is a meat-eating animal (carnivore). It is the largest meat-eating marsupial in the world.
It is recognized by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, strong odor, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. It may feed alone or with other devils in a particular location.
Tasmanian devils are protected. The Devil Facial Tumour Disease is now having a devastating effect on the Tasmanian devil population. The disease was first noticed in the north-east of Tasmania in the mid-1990s. It has become more prevalent in recent times in other areas of the State.
