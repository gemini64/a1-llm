Rain in Greece
Rain is when liquid droplets of water fall down from the sky. It happens when water vapor in the air condenses to form droplets in clouds.
Some wet biomes, such as rainforests, get a lot of rain each year. Some dry biomes, such as deserts, get very little or no rain each year.
If the temperature is near or below the freezing point of water (0°C/32°F), rain may change to snow, sleet, or freezing rain.
