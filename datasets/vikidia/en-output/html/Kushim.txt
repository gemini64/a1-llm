Kushim is supposedly the earliest known recorded name of a person in writing. The name "Kushim" is found on several Uruk period (c. 3400â€“3000 BC) clay tablets used to record transactions of barley. It is unknown if the name refers to an individual, or a generic title of an officeholder or an institution.
