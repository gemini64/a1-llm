Butterscotch / Hot Fudge Sundae
An ice cream sundae is an American dessert invention. The sundae consists of vanilla ice cream topped with a flavored sauce or syrup, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. Sometimes fresh fruits are added.
Classic sundaes are typically named after the canned or bottled flavored syrup used in the recipe: cherry sundae, chocolate sundae, strawberry sundae, raspberry sundae, etc.
The classic sundae is traditionally served in a tulip-shaped, footed glass vase. Due to the long association between the shape of the glass and the dessert, this style of serving dish is generally now known as a sundae glass.
The sundae's origins are debated, but recipes were being printed in 1900. The oldest-known written evidence of a sundae is Platt & Colt's newspaper ad for a "Cherry Sunday" placed in the Ithaca Daily Journal on April 5, 1892.
