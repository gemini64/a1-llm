Bitcoin is a electronic currency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
The bitcoin is based on blockchain technology which secures payments. Bitcoin is the first currency to use the blockchain. The blockchain technology is decentralized ; this means that there is no single organization, nor country, nor individual, that can invalidate the payments.
This currency has a total number of coins fixed in advance : there will only be 21 millions bitcoins. This limit aims to avoid inflation (raise of prices). It is the main difference with classical currencies which total supply of currency is regulated by central banks.
Bitcoin is still young and raised several concerns. It is decentralized and anonymous and has been used by illegal traffics. Also, Bitcoin's price has fluctuated a lot and was subject to several bubbles (big raise and big fall of the price).
