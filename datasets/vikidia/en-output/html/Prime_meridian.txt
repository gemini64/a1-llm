A prime meridian is an arbitrarily-chosen meridian (line of longitude) in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. Together, a prime meridian and its anit-meridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great circle. The great circle divides a spheroid such as Earth, into two hemispheres: the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere.
Various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions throughout history for Earth. The current international standard prime meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian, which is derived from but differs slightly, from the Greenwich Meridian, the previous standard.
