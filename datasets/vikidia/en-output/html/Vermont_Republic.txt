The Vermont Republic was an independent country which existed from 1777 to 1791.
On 15 January 1777, the Republic declared independence from Great Britain. Many Vermonters fought for America in the American Revolution, but the Continental Congress (the American government at the time) did not recognise Vermont's independence. So, members representing Vermont negotiated with the British to join the British Province of Quebec, the British accepted the negotiations but the British surrendered at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, causing Vermont to negotiate to become a part of the United States instead.
On 4 May 1791, the republic was admitted into the union as the State of Vermont.
