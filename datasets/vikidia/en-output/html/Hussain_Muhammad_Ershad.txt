He served as the Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army and later became the President of Bangladesh, holding office from 1983 to 1990. Ershad was a key figure in shaping the political trajectory of Bangladesh during the 1980s.

Early Life and Military Career:

He joined the Pakistan Military Academy and was commissioned into the Pakistan Army in 1952. Ershad rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army in 1978.

Presidency:
In 1982, Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup, overthrowing the elected government of President A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury. He assumed the presidency in 1983 and continued in office until his resignation in 1990. A mix of economic reforms and political repression marked Ershad's presidency. He initiated the introduction of a market-oriented economy, but his regime faced criticism for human rights abuses and curtailment of political freedoms.

Political Reforms:

In the face of mounting pressure, Ershad resigned from the presidency on December 6, 1990, ushering in a new era of multiparty democracy in Bangladesh.
