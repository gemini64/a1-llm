A forest is an area of land with many trees. Many different kinds of plants and animals live in forests. There are three main types of forests.

Coniferous forests
Coniferous forests are forests that have coniferous trees (evergreen trees with needlelike leaves). They are commonly found in high latitude and high altitude regions, such as Canada and the northern United States.

Deciduous forests
Deciduous forests are forests that have deciduous trees (trees that lose their leaves in autumn). They are commonly found in temperate regions, such as Europe.

Rain forests
Rain forests are forests that get a lot of rain and have many dense plants. They are commonly found in tropical regions, such as northern South America and central Africa.
