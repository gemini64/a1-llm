A game where the X wins
Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os is a game for two people that only requires pencil and paper, although you can also use a board with tokens.
The board (which can be a drawing on a paper or wherever) consists of a square that is crossed by two vertical and two horizontal lines, so in total there are three small squares left in the top line, another 3 in the center line and 3 more in the bottom line.
Each player takes turns drawing a cross or a circle in a square (or placing tokens of different shapes or colors) The winner is the one who manages to place three equal pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally (the diagonal is the inclined straight line that connects the opposite corners of the square).
