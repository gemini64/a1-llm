The ketogenic diet is a strictly limited carbohydrate, protein and caloric balance and therefore the form of dietary-fat diet that mimics the starvation metabolism in certain aspects. Through them, however, the body gets its energy demand of body fat (as in starvation) but from dietary fat. Ketogenic diet is used as a method of therapy, especially in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, glucose transporter malfunction and pyruvatedehydrogenase deficiency. You must be calculated individually and monitored by a physician. A non-medically induced special form of ketogenic diet are so-called low-carb diets such as the Atkins diet (*)
