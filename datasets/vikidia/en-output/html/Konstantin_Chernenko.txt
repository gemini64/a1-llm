Konstantin Chernenko in 1973
Konstantin Ustinovich Chernenko (September 24, 1911 - March 10, 1985) was a Soviet politician. General Secretary of the Soviet Union from February 13, 1984 until his death. Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from April 11 1984 until his death. Born in Bolshaya Tes, Novoselsky Raion, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Siberia. Joined Komsomol in 1926 and the Communist Party in 1931. After a brief stint in the Frontier Guard he was career politician. After work in the regions he was called to Moscow in 1960 and promoted under the aegis of Brezhnev, becoming a candidate memeber of the Central Committee in 1966 and a full member in 1971. He joined the Politburo in October 1977, becoming a full member in November 1978. Following the death of Brezhnev in 1982 Chernenko lost the power-struggle and nominated Andropov as General Secretary. Andrpov died in February 1984 after less than 15 months in office, despite concerns over his health Chernenko was elected to replace him. The poor health of Chernenko made him unable to govern effectively. His frequent absences from office left little doubt that his reign had only been an interim measure in a longer struggle between conservatives and reformers. Chernenko died in office in March 1985.
