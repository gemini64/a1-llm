Government is a plan where political power is used to rule a country. Three main types of government are democracy, totalitarian, and authoritarian. Most countries also are divided between federal governments where regions are self-governing, and unitary governments with more central control. Also there are presidential governments where the leader is directly elected and parliamentary governments where elected representatives choose the government's leaders.
