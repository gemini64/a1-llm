Hoplite
A hoplite was a citizen-soldier in Ancient Greece. He was armed with a spear and a shield, and fought in the phalanx formation. They received some basic military training, and bought their own bronze armor. The word hoplite is derived from hoplon, a kind of shield. It is unknown exactly when hoplite warfare began, but the eighth or seventh century BC is a possibility. Hoplite warfare diminished after the Peloponesian Wars.
