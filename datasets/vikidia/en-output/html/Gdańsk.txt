Gdańsk is a city in Poland, on the Baltic Sea coast. It is mentioned in documents as old as from the 10th century. It was one of the main cities part of the Hanseatic League (an association of cities that controlled trade in Northern Europe during the Middle Ages).
It is also well known under its German name Danzig, as it was part of Prussia and Germany for nearly 125 years in recent history. Today no Germans live there, only Polish and Kaschubian people.
After World War II, Gdańsk became the largest port of Poland. The Polish trade union federation "Solidarność" (meaning Solidarity) was born in 1980 in Gdansk shipyards. Solidarność has then be a major player in the Polish transition to democracy during the next decade.
