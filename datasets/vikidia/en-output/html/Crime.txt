A crime is any act that is punishable by law. Every crime breaks the law, but it can be difficult to judge, because not everything that breaks the law is a crime. Crimes are offences for which you can be arrested by the Police. Other things which break the law, for example, breaking a contract, are not classed as crimes, but are still dealt with by the courts. This is done through a Private Prosecution, that is, where a person brings a case to court in order to deal with something a person or company has done wrong, but which doesn't count as a crime.
