Okavango Delta, Botswana
The Okavango Delta is a vast inland delta in Botswana, Africa. Unlike most rivers that flow into the sea, the Okavango River empties into the Kalahari Desert, creating a lush oasis. This delta spans approximately 2,023,590 hectares, with a buffer zone of 2,286,630 hectares. (*)

How It Forms
Originating in the highlands of Angola, the Okavango River traverses Namibia before reaching Botswana. Instead of flowing into an ocean, the river disperses over the flat terrain of the Kalahari Desert, forming the delta. This process results in a network of channels, lagoons, and islands.

A Home for Wildlife

The Okavango Delta is teeming with life, hosting diverse flora and fauna. It provides a habitat for numerous plant species, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Animals such as elephants, lions, cheetahs, and African wild dogs inhabit this region. Bird enthusiasts can observe species like the African fish eagle and the lilac-breasted roller.

Seasons and Floods
Annually, the delta undergoes seasonal flooding. Rainfall from Angola flows down the Okavango River, reaching the delta months later, typically between March and June. During this period, the delta can expand to three times its usual size, providing vital water and sustenance for many species.

People and Culture
Several communities, including the Batswana and San peoples, reside around the Okavango Delta. These groups have coexisted harmoniously with the environment for centuries, relying on fishing, farming, and hunting. Their rich cultural traditions reflect a profound connection to the land.

A Special Place
In 2014, the Okavango Delta was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique ecosystem and significance to wildlife. It also stands as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa. Ongoing conservation efforts aim to preserve this remarkable environment for future generations.
The Okavango Delta is a natural wonder, providing a sanctuary for wildlife and a vital source of life within a desert landscape.
