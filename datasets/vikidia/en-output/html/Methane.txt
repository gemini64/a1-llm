Methane
Methane, a chemical compound with the chemical symbol CH4, comprises one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. It is classified as an alkane and a significant natural gas component. Its abundance makes it a desirable fuel, but its gaseous form at average temperatures makes transportation difficult. Atmospheric Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a higher global warming potential per unit than carbon dioxide. In 1998, the concentration of Methane in the Earth's atmosphere was 1745 n.mol/mol (parts per billion, ppb), measured in moles per moles.
