Spaghetti and meatballs in a close-up view
Spaghetti and meatballs is an Italian-American dish. It is composed of spaghetti pasta, tomato sauce, and meatballs. It is served hot, sometimes with grated Parmesan cheese atop it. Italian immigrants to the United States created the dish. The first recipe for the dish was published in 1920. Similar dishes exist in Italy (and predate spaghetti and meatballs), but these dishes are typically served with the spaghetti and tomato sauce separate from the meatballs.
