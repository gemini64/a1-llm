Euripides (c. 480 â€“ 406 BC) was an ancient Greek writer of plays. He was born on Salamis and died in Macedonia. He wrote about 90 plays, but only 18 or 19 have survived. Fragments of others are extant.
His best known plays include Medea, Iphigenia at Tauris, and The Trojan Women. He took three first prizes in the ancient world for the plays Hippolytus, Bacchae, and Iphigenia at Aulis.
