Armistice Day is a holiday that celebrates the end of World War One every year on 11 November. This date is used because 11 November 1918 was the day the Allies and Germany agreed to stop fighting. (*)
Many countries recognize Armistice Day as a national holiday, and hold ceremonies to pay respects to people who died during the first world war, and other wars as well. Some countries call the holiday Rememberence Day. The United States of America calls it Veteran's Day, and celebrates veterans who fought in war and lived, while a different holiday called Memorial Day pays respects to people who died.
