The barn owl (scientific name: Tyto alba) is a very common owl, widespread in nearly the whole world.

Behaviour

Diet
Like all birds of prey, the barn owl is a carnivore. It hunts mainly rodents, such as mice and voles, but will also eat small birds, insects and sometimes even fish, frogs and lizards. It goes out most of the time at night and locates its prey thanks to its excellent hearing.
The barn owl is unable to digest hair and bones, so it spits them out in the form of balls called "pellets".

Breeding
Three owlets.
Barn owls generally form pairs and stay with the same partner for the rest of their lives.
It generally lays 5 or 6 eggs, but sometimes twice as many when there is a lot of prey. The female incubates them and is fed by the male.

In litterature
Soren, the hero of the fantasy series Guardians of Ga'Hoole, is a barn owl.
