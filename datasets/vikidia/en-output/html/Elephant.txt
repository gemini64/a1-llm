A herd of African elephants
The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. It is a grey-skinned mammal with tusks, and a very long nose, called a trunk.
There are two species of elephants: the Asian elephant, and the African elephant. The African is larger than the Asian. It has big ears, and really long tusks. This species lives in the African grasslands called the savannah.

The Asian elephant is smaller. It is native to Asia. It can be domesticated. Generally, Asian elephants do not have tusks. The Asian elephant is an endangered species.
