Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with art (including defining what art is) and beauty.
It studies our taste, i.e. the value that we associate to what our senses perceive, and attempts to identify standards that objects need to reach to be considered beautiful. Those standards differ between cultures and evolve over time.
