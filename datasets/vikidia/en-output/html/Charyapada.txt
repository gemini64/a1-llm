Charyapada is the oldest collection of verses in the Bengali language. It is also the oldest composition of the neo-Indian Aryan language. The composers of these hymns, composed between the eighth and twelfth centuries AD, were simply Buddhist Siddhacharyas. They composed the verses for the purpose of explaining the esoteric meaning of Buddhism in symbolic form. The branch of Bengali instrumental music also originated from this charyapada. He considers it a scriptural work. At the same time the social and natural imagery of contemporary Bengal is brilliant in these terms. Its literary quality is still impressive. In 1906, Mahamopadhyay Haraprasad Shastri recovered a fragmentary book of Charya from the library of the royal court of Nepal. Later, Acharya Sunitikumar Chattopadhyay, through linguistic analysis, established the undeniable link of the Bengali language with the Charyapas with scientific reasoning. The main poets of Charyapada are Luipad, Kahnpad, Vusukupad, Shabarpad etc.
