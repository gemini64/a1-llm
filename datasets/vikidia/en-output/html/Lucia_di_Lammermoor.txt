Gaetano Donizetti about 1835
Lucia di Lammermoor is a tragic opera in three acts with music by Gaetano Donizetti and words by Salvadore Cammarano. The opera is based on the novel, The Bride of Lammermoor by Sir Walter Scott. Lucia di Lammermoor was first performed on 26 September 1835 at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Italy.
The story is about a fragile young Scottish maiden who is forced into an unwanted marriage by her brother. On the evening of her wedding, she stabs her husband to death, then collapses and dies.
The opera is filled with memorable arias and ensembles, the most memorable being the sextet and Lucia's lengthy mad scene at the end of the opera. With Bellini's Norma and Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Lucia is considered the perfect representative of the bel canto school of Italian opera.
