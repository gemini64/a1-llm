Irish soda bread
Irish soda bread is a traditional quick bread made with baking soda instead of yeast. In Ireland, soda bread is made with a soft flour such as cake or pastry flour. Live yoghurt or stout (a strong beer) sometimes replaces the traditional buttermilk. Mixing is kept to a minimum and the bread is not kneaded. Raisins, nuts, butter, and eggs may also be added.
