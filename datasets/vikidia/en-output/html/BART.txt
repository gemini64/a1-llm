The BART (acronym for Bay Area Rapid Transit) is a train circulating in the Bay Area of San Francisco, California, United States. Opened in 1972, it has 44 stations, five lines 167 km of total length.
The BART is a commuter train, also called "suburban rail", because it's meant to link San Francisco to the towns surrounding it. The BART can carry more passengers than a subway or a tram, and its lines go further; it runs also faster: its average speed is about 55 km/h (35 mph) with maximums at 110–130 km/h, whereas the average speeds are 35–40 km/h for a subway and 15–25 km/h for a tram. This train looks also wider than others because the width of the rails is significantly higher than normal (1676 mm instead of the standard 1435 mm).
