Story

Robert Louis Stevenson in 1870
Young Jim Hawkins finds a treasure map belonging to a dead pirate, once a guest at his mother's seaside inn. His friends Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney organize a treasure hunt.
Unfortunately, pirates led by peg-legged Long John Silver interfere with the progress of the voyage and the hunt.
On the island, the treasure hunters and the pirates vie for possession of the ship and the treasure. The treasure hunters finally succeed and sail for England, leaving the pirates marooned on the island.

Influences

The book is responsible for establishing the popular modern image of pirates as peg-legged, eyepatch-wearing hooligans with parrots on their shoulders. Enduring motifs first established in the novel include treasure chests, treasure maps marked with an X, the Black Spot, and dotty old pirate castaways.

Adaptations

In 1950, Treasure Island was the first color production and the first live action movie from Walt Disney Productions. It starred Bobby Driscoll as Jim Hawkins and Robert Newton as Long John Silver. Newton's interpretation of Long John Silver is the definitive version for many.
