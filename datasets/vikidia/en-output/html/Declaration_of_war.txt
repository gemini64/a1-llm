A declaration of war is a formal announcement by one country to another, signaling the start or anticipation of war. The authority to declare war varies among nations. In some cases, the head of state has this power, while other nations may authorize war-like actions through alternative means. International law, particularly the United Nations Charter, has made declarations of war largely outdated in global relations, as it prohibits the threat and use of force in international conflicts. The United Nations Security Council has the authority to authorize collective action to maintain peace and security. Declarations of war have become extremely rare since World War II, with different perspectives on the reasons behind this decline. Some argue that states try to avoid the constraints of international humanitarian law, while others believe that war declarations are seen as acts of aggression and extreme ambitions.
