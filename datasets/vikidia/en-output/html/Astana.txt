Astana
Astana is the capital city of Kazakhstan. In the years 1998 to 2019 the city's name was Astana, one of a series of renamings over the centuries. On March 23, 2019, the country's parliament voted unanimously to change the name to honor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who served as President of Kazakhstan from 1990 to 2019.
In September 2022, the name of the capital was changed back to Astana.
