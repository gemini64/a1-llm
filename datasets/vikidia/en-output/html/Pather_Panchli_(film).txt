The film's production faced financial problems and was interrupted, leading to its completion after three long years. The film was made on a low production budget with amateur actors and inexperienced artists. Sitar player Ravi Shankar composed the film's score using Ragas, an Indian classical music. Subrata Mitra was responsible for cinematography, and Dulal Dutta was in charge of editing. The film was first exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City on May 3, 1955, and later released in Calcutta the same year to critical acclaim. Critics praised the realism, humanity, and quality displayed in the film, but some considered its slow pace a shortcoming.
Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy, which includes Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajit (1956), and Apur Sansar (1959), depicts the life of Apu. Pather Panchali is a pioneering film in the Indian film industry that showcases the country's social realities. It was the first independent Indian film to gain international recognition, winning several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Film in 1955. The film also won the Best Humanitarian Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, solidifying Satyajit Ray's status as one of India's greatest filmmakers. Due to its cinematic brilliance, the film is often included in lists of the world's best films.
