The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is novel by French writer Alexandre Dumas, which he completed in 1844. Along with The Three Musketeers, it is viewed as one of the most popular works of the author.
The story takes place between 1815 and 1839 in France, Italy and several Mediterranean Islands and begins after Napoleon escapes from Elba and becomes the emperor of France again. The young Edmond Dantès, who is going to marry the beautiful Mercedes, is accused of treason and has to go to jail. But it is a set-up. His few-prisoner Abbé Faria gives him instructions to find a treasure, which is held secret on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond escapes from the island and finds the treasure. As the powerful and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, he takes revenge on the people who wrongly accused him.
The book is a classic and the inspiration of many adventure novels. According to Luc Sante, the Count of Monte Cristo is so important to western culture as Mickey Mouse and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.
