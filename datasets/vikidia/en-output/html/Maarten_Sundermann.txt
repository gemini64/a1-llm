His artistic practice, deeply influenced by film and theatre, is characterized by an interplay of detail, unconventional composition, and surrealism—elements that define his signature style.

Early Life and Education

He holds a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Directing from the New York Film Academy, where he was mentored by Hollywood veterans, including producers behind "Ali," "Star Trek" (Adam Nimoy), and "The Thomas Crown Affair." He was awarded a prestigious film scholarship by Brett Ratner via his production company known for "The Revenant," "X-Men The Last Stand," and "Prison Break," further cementing his foundation in storytelling and visual composition. After completing his MFA, he began his career as a personal assistant to Director Roman Coppola and the Coppola family at The Directors Bureau and American Zoetrope.
