Greta Thunberg is a Swedish female activist, who campaigns against climate change.  She became famous as a teenager for starting the Friday "School Strike" movement, to draw attention to the fact that the climate that adults are damaging, would affect children as they'd be the ones inheriting the damage that the current older generations left behind.
