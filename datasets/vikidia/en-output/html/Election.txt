An election is the process by which a leader or representative is chosen in a democratic political system, by the citizens.
Most of the time, winning an election requires winning at least 50% of total votes.
Depending on countries, election can be direct (citizens directly vote for a candidate) or indirect (citizens vote for people who will themselves vote for a candidate).
