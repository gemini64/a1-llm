Subject

The subject of the painting is probably Lisa Gherardini, the wife of silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo of Florence, Italy. Mona is a form of Madonna (my lady) in Italian. Her smile has caused comment for centuries.

Ownership

King Francis I of France bought the painting, and kept it at the Palace of Fontainebleau. The painting was given to King Louis XIV of France. He moved the painting to the Palace of Versailles.  In 1797, it was placed on display in The Louvre in Paris. It hangs there now. It was removed for safety several times during modern wars. It is the property of France.

Theft

In 1911, the Mona Lisa was stolen by an Italian museum guard. The thief took it to Italy. He was hailed by many Italians as a patriot and a national hero. The painting was displayed around Italy in several places. In 1913, the painting was returned to The Louvre.

Vandalism

Twice in 1956, the painting was slightly damaged by vandals, but restored. In 1974 and 2009, the painting again was attacked by vandals, but was unharmed. It is now displayed behind bullet-proof glass in a heat and humidity controlled room.
