Dawn spacecraft in asteroid belt
An asteroid, or minor planet is a small rocky body orbiting in our Solar System.
The largest asteroid is Ceres about 578 miles across, about the distance from Chicago to Washington, D.C. The smallest ones are less than half a mile across.
Scientists have made a list of over 300,000 asteroids. There may be over a million of them just in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.
