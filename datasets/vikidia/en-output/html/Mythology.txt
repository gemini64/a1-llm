Mythology is a collection of myths, especially one belonging to a particular religious or cultural tradition. Myths are stories that are rooted in a culture's beliefs and values, often explaining natural phenomena, the origins of the world, and the customs and ideals of a society. (*)

Functions of Myth
Myths serve several functions within a culture:

Explanatory: Myths explain the origins of the world and natural phenomena. For example, Greek mythology explains the changing seasons through the story of Persephone and Hades. (*)

Social: Myths reinforce social norms and traditions. The Norse myth of Yggdrasil, the world tree, reflects the interconnectedness of all life. (*)
