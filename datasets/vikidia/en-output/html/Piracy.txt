Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by a ship on another ship or coastal area.
Piracy existed as early as the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples attacked ships in the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. Piracy flourished between the 1650s and 1730s, in what is known as the Golden Age of Piracy. The period included several notable pirates such as Blackbeard.
