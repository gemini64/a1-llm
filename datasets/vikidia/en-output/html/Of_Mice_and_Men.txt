Of Mice and Men is a short novel by John Steinbeck. It was published in 1937. It tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers, who move from place to place in search of new job opportunities during the Great Depression in California, United States and alight on a small ranch. Lennie is a strong, mentally disabled man who never leaves George's side, relying on him for decision making and companionship. Tragedy occurs when Lennie accidentally kills a young woman while fondling her dress, causing them to be driven out of the town of Weed just before the book starts.  The book originally received positive responses from critics, but was censored and abhorred for its vulgarity and racist language. The book has been adapted to movies, an opera, and a stage play.
