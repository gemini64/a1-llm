A grandmother is a grandparent, they are your mother's mother ("maternal grandmother") or your father's mother ("paternal grandmother").
The male equivalent is grandfather.
A grandparent's mother is called a great grandmother, their mother is a "great great grandmother", and their mother is a "great great great grandmother" and their mother is a "great great great great grandmother" and so on.
However, numbers are usually used to refer to great grandmother after a few generations, for example 4th great grandmother rather than "great great great great grandmother".
