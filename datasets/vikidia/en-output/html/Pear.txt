Two pears on a tree
A pear is an edible fruit. Its color is normally green or yellow with a slight pink or red blush on one side. It is grown in orchards in moderate climates around the world. Pear trees are sometimes espaliered in small spaces.
The most famous pear tree in the English-speaking world is probably that in the Christmas carol, "The Twelve Days of Christmas": "On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree".

Pears can be eaten raw or cooked. The fruit is an ingredient in several dishes that include Poire belle Hélène, a concoction  of pears, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and candied violets created in 1869 by Auguste Escoffier to celebrate Jacques Offenbach's operetta La Belle Hélène.
