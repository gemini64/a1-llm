In physics, a wave is a repeating pattern of energy.

Parts of a wave
The top of a wave is called the crest or the peek. The bottom of the wave is called the trough. The length between crest to crest or trough to trough is called a wavelength. The height of the wave from its resting point is called the amplitude. The amount of waves that pass a point per second is the wave's frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz.
