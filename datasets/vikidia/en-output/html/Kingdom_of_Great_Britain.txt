The Kingdom of Great Britain was a country which existed from 1707 to 1800. It included England, Wales, and Scotland, and was in personal union (shared the same monarchy) with the Kingdom of Ireland (not to be confused with the modern-day Republic of Ireland).
It was created with the Acts of Union on 1 May 1707, which combined the previously seperate Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into the united Kingdom of Great Britain. On 31 December 1800, the kingdom merged with the Kingdom of Ireland which was previously in a personal union to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
