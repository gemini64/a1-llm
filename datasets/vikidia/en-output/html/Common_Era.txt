Common Era (CE) is commonly used in the Western World for the year number part of a date.  The year numbers are the same as those used for Anno Domini (AD). In both systems the current year is 2025. The CE and AD systems both started with the year 1.  Neither system uses a year zero (0). Common Era is abbreviated as CE, and is also known as Current Era and Christian Era.
Before Common Era (BCE) is the system for the years Before the Common Era. BCE uses the same numbering as BC or Before Christ. "CE" and "BCE" are placed after the year number. Thus we read "Right now our year is 2025 CE" or "Artaxerxes III of Persia was born in 425 BCE."
The year-numbering used in the Gregorian calendar is based on a 6th century estimate for the year Jesus was born. The use of Anno Domini (Latin for "in year of the/our Lord") has been used with the Western calendar since about that time. The use of Before Christ and the abbreviations AD and BC came somewhat later. The Gregorian calendar is an internationally recognized standard and has become the most widely used calendar in the world, used by both Christians and non-Christians. Use of Common Era notation (CE/BCE) does not make use of religious titles (Lord and  Christ) for Jesus that are part of in the AD/BC notation. Usage of Common Era notation began about 1615 among Christians in Europe, and has been growing among non-Christians and among Christians who desire to be sensitive to non-Christians.
