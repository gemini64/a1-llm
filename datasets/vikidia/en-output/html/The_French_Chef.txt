Julia Child
The French Chef was a television show that aired in the United States from February 11, 1963 to 1973. It was hosted by Julia Child. The French Chef was one of the first cooking shows on American television. It was produced and broadcast by WGBH, the public television station in Boston, Massachusetts.
The format consisted of Child preparing dishes from her cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Recipes were those within the abilities of the American home cook such as French Onion Soup, Quiche Lorraine, and Bûche de Noël. She closed every show with the catchphrase, "Bon appetit!"
In 1964, Child received a Peabody Award, crediting her for doing "more than show us how good cooking is achieved; by her delightful demonstrations she has brought the pleasures of good living into many American homes." In May 1966, her show won a Primetime Emmy Award for Achievements in Educational Television – Individuals.
