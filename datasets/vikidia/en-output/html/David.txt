David
David is a marble sculpture by Michelangelo. It was created between 1501 and 1504, and stands 5.17-metre (17 ft) tall.
The statue was intended to be placed on the roof of the Florence Cathedral, but was instead placed in a public square, outside the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence. It was unveiled on 8 September 1504.
