In Europe and other places an international system of paper sizes is used. The normal size of paper is called A4. It is measured in metric. It is 210 millimeters wide and 297 millimeters long. This is about the size of US letter, but it is a little narrower, and a little longer.
The other common size of paper in Europe is called B5. It is 176 millimeters wide by 250 millimeters long. This is about the same as executive size in the United States. It is sometimes used for writing personal letters to people.
There are also many other paper sizes used for writing notes, for big posters, for books, and for other things.
In the international paper size system, the sizes are based on mathematical formulas. A0 is the biggest. Its area equals one square meter. A1 is half as big as A0. A2 is half as big as A1, and so on. The sizes with "B" and "C" in their name are in between the "A" sizes.
