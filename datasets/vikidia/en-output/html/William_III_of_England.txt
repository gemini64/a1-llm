William III of England
William III (4 November 1650 â€“ 8 March 1702), was a Dutch Protestant noble, Prince of Orange, stadholder Dutch Republic, and the King of Scots, England and Ireland.
He won the Scottish and English crowns in the Glorious Revolution, as the son-in-law and nephew of the overthrown King James II. He ruled together with Jacob's daughter Maria II , and after her death he ruled independently until his death. Although he belonged to the Dutch dynasty, Orange-Nassau, William is usually included in the list of English and Scottish rulers in Stuarte, to which his mother and wife belonged.
William became the stadholder of the Republic of the Netherlands on June 28, 1672. He took part in many wars waged against Catholic France and its King Louis XIV, which is why Protestants considered him their leader. Behind his reputation stood a powerful army and fleet of warships, which was one of the most powerful in Europe at the time.
