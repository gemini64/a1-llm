Waitangi day
Waitangi is a place in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand.
Waitangi day can also be called “New Zealand day”, so, from there it’s pretty obvious it’s celebrated in New Zealand. It’s celebrated because in 1840, representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Maori chiefs signed what is New Zealand’s founding document. The day was first officially commemorated in 1934, and it has been a public holiday since 1974. Waitangi day is also New Zealand’s national day so therefore all schools are closed. It’s celebrated on the Sixth of February. Various activities and events are held at the Waitangi Treaty Grounds. It’s a day that bubbles with ceremonies, music, sports and fun. Waitangi Day itself has always involved performances and parades from the Royal New Zealand Navy and local cultural groups.
