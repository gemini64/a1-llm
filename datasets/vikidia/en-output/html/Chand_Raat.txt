Chand Raat (Urdu: چاند رات, Hindi: चाँद रात, Bengali: চাঁদ রাত; literally "Night of the Moon") is a South Asian Islamic observance celebrated on the eve of the festival of Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It can also refer to any night with a new moon for the new Islamic month of Shawwal.

Celebrations:
Chand Raat is a joyful occasion that is filled with celebrations and excitement. It is a time when families and friends come together in open areas such as rooftops or bazaars to spot the new moon. This new moon signals the arrival of Eid, which is eagerly awaited. Traditionally, people used to gather on rooftops and look for the moon together, sharing stories and laughter. In modern times, people often gather in parks or other public spaces, creating a festive atmosphere with music, decorations, and fireworks.
