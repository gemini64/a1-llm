Scarlet Witch is a Marvel superhero who has recently featured in the Avengers movies and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. She is an adept wielder of chaos magic, and can alter reality. This ability was best shown when she altered reality in the comic series House of M.
Although Scarlet Witch is a superhero, she has been known to go insane, as she did in the House of M. She is considered to be the Nexus being of reality 616, meaning she is that reality's source, making her extremely powerful.
