Golf is a sport. It is played with a small white ball called a golf ball.

Rules

In golf, the goal is to get the golf ball into the hole with as few shots as possible. "Rounds" of golf are typically played in 18 or 9 different holes.
Types of golf clubs include Irons. There are 9 types of irons, the higher the number, the less powerful, and 1, 3, and 5 woods. Woods are more powerful than Irons, but like irons the lower the number the more powerful.
Golf courses will typically have pits of sand, also known as "bunkers". When a ball lands in a bunker, the only club a player may use is called a sand wedge.
A club known as a putter is often used by golfers when they are close to the hole.
