FlipaClip is a free animation program available on Android, iOS and Windows. This program is a very basic app that introduce you to the world of animated shorts.
It allows you to draw a frame to later on change some elements on the layers that give movement effect as you play the frames. For better results, it is recommended to prepare the project to 24 frames per second. Making an even fluid animation will make you draw more frames per second (max√≠mum 30/second).
