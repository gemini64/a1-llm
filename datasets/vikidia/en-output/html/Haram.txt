Haram (Arabic: حَرَام ḥarām) is an Islamic term. By this is meant forbidden work. Haram is considered to be the most serious of the evil deeds. If a deed is haram, it cannot be done for any good purpose. However, if a person commits haram acts out of helplessness, it is not considered a sin. Haram is mentioned in the Quran and Hadith. Besides, some haram matters are determined through ijtihad. In all these cases, there may be differences in the rules of different madhhabs.
