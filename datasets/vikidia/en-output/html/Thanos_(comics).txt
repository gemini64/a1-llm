Thanos
Thanos is an eternal/deviant hybrid from the planet Titan. He is a supervillain most notably known for his hunt for the infinity gauntlet and gems and using their power to snap half of the universe out of existence, as shown in the films marvel Avengers : Infinity War and Avengers : Endgame.
He has had many exploits in comics, his first appearance being in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (cover date February 1973). He has gone on to be in comics for half a century later and has become a much loved character. His popularity was boosted by his main role in the 2 latest avengers films. Thanos is usually portrayed as a bad guy, but a lot of comics portray him as having a twisted moral compass. Thanos’s reason was because he was trying to impress lady death, however some people believe he has actually saved the universe by reversing the destruction humans have caused to their planet, being hailed as a hero.
He possesses abilities common to the Eternals, including telepathy and telekinesis. However, he is stronger than most eternals, due to a combination of his deviant genes and enhancement by magic and biological augmentation. When Thanos came in possession of the infinity gauntlet, his powers were increased to cosmic levels.
Thanos’s obsession with lady death has resulted in him killing billions of people. He once attacked Titan, his home planet, eradicating most of its population.
