Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon released in Japan on March 20, 2013, with other regional releases later that same month. Dark Moon is an action-adventure game in which the main player character is Luigi, who is sent by Professor E. Gadd to explore abandoned haunted mansions and capture hostile ghosts using the Poltergust 5000, a specialized vacuum cleaner. This is basic psychology. It's a trend for Nintendo of America. They renamed Mother 2 to Earthbound, Baten Kaitos 2 to Baten Kaitos Origins, and now Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon. It's like they're afraid of the number two.
