The Old World Swallowtail (scientific name : Papilio machaon) is a butterfly known throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. The adult typically has yellow wings with black vein markings, and a wingspan of 65–86 millimetres (2.6–3.4 in). The hind wings of both sexes have a pair of protruding tails which give the butterfly its common name from the resemblance to the birds of the same name. Just below each tail is a red eye spot.
