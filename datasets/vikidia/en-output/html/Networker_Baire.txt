Networker Baire is a 2021 Bangladeshi web video created by Mizanur Rahman Arian from Network, with Redwan Rony as the producer. The story follows four friends who recently graduated from university and their experiences of joy, pain, travel, and unexpected events. Shariful Raj, Rohan, Khairul Basar, and Junayed Bogda played the four friends' roles.
This is Arian's debut video, originally intended to be released in cinemas. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it could not be released in theatres. Consequently, the film was launched on Top Platform Charki on August 19th, 2021. Following its release, the film received widespread critical acclaim.
