The woolly mammoth (scientific name : Mammuthus primigenius) is a mammoth lived in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. They evolved about 5 million years ago and became extinct about 4,500 years ago.
When they lived in northern Europe, the continent was covered with ice and tundra. These northern species adapted to cold climate however; they grew hairy coats. They were killed off by hunters and climate change.
