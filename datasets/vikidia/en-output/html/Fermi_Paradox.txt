The Fermi Paradox is a puzzling question from about the year 1950. Enrico Fermi asked other scientists "Where are the aliens?". Since the universe is so big and so old, he thought we should have been visited or contacted already. Some scientists think that even though we have not seen or heard aliens, they might still exist without humans knowing.
