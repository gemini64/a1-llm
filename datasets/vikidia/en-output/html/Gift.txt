thumb|A gift
A gift is something that another person gives voluntarily and without asking for something in return. It can be an object such as toys, flowers, money, etc. or something intangible like a drawing or a poem.
Gifts are usually given at parties such as birthdays or weddings, but they can also be done to congratulate a person for an achievement or to compensate them for some harm we have caused them, among other reasons.
