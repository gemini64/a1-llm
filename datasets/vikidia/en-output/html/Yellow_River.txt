Map of the Yellow River
The Yellow River (also called the Huang He) is a river in China. The Huang He is approximately 3,395 miles long. It is the second longest river in China, after the Yangtze River. It finds its source around the Bayar Har Mountains and its mouth in the Bohai Sea. The river flows through Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Jinan, Lanzhou, Kaifeng, Yinchuan, Baotou and Wuhai. 
Traditionally, the Chinese called it China’s Sorrow. This is due to the river’s tendency to overflow leading to devastating floods. Described as the world’s most heavily silted river, the Huang He is believed to have caused 1,500 floods since the 2nd century BCE. These floods have caused unimaginable deaths. 
The Huang He has long been considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. It is thought that many years ago, Buddhist leaders followed the river to achieve their state of mind.
