L'Homme au Masque de Fer (The Man in the Iron Mask)
The Man in the Iron Mask (French: L'Homme au Masque de Fer; died 19 November 1703) was an French unknown prisoner who went by the name "Eustache Dauger". (*)  He was arrested on July 28, 1669, and imprisoned on August 24. He stayed in custody for 34 years, under the supervision of the same jailer, BÃ©nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, in four different French prisons, including the Bastille. He eventually passed away on November 19, 1703, with his burial certificate using the name "Marchioly". Some 19th-century historians believed he might have been the Italian diplomat Ercole Antonio Mattioli.
