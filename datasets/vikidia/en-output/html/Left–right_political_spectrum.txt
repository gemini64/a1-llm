The left–right political spectrum is a political spectrum that marks political views on a 1 Dimensional axis from left to right. The left tend to be more in favour of progressiveism, nationalisation, centrally planned economies, social welfare, multiculturalism, globalism, and immigration whereas the right tend to be more in favour of conservatism, private industry, free market capitalism, nationalism, patriotism, and anti-immigration.

The political compass is a more advanced form of the left–right political compass, which marks political views in 2D, with an added y axis that represents how much power the government should have, the higher up on the axis the more "Authoritarian" (government having more power) they are and the lower on the axis the more "Libertarian" (government having less power) they are.
