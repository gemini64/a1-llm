The archaeobotany, the plant remains collected by water-flotation of soil samples. A technique developed in the U.S. Midwest in the 1980 and gradually adopted in other regions. Dr. Jack Rossen, invited by a Fulbright Scholarship, introduced in Chile, not only flotation tank, also controlled carbonizationn studies (to understand shrinkage and deformation that archaeological material experiences).
