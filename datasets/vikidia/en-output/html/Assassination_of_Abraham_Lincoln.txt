Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, while the victim was attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater in Washington. The murder occurred during the closing stages of the American Civil War, five days after the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's confederate troops to Union troops commanded by Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox.
