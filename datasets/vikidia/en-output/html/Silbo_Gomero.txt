Silbo Gomero is a way of speaking Spanish used by residents of La Gomera in the Canary Islands of Spain.

History

The Guanche language once spoken in the Canary Islands also had a whistled form. By the time the Spanish began to settle in the Canary Islands, Silbo was adapted into the Spanish language. It was designed so residents could send information through the mountains quickly.
But by the time the telephone was invented, it started seeing less use. Today, it is primarily used for public announcements.
