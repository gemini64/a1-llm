The Highland Games are famous for their unique and often challenging events. Some of the most popular include:

Caber Toss – This is perhaps the most iconic     event of the Highland Games. Athletes must lift a large wooden log, called     a caber, and toss it end over end. The goal is to flip the caber so     that it lands in a specific way, with the smaller end touching the ground.
Hammer Throw – In this event, competitors throw a     heavy weight, known as a hammer, as far as possible. Unlike the Olympic     hammer throw, athletes in the Highland Games do not spin before releasing     the hammer.
Tug of War – A classic test of teamwork, the tug     of war challenges two teams to pull on opposite ends of a rope, trying to     drag the other team across a designated line.
Weight for Height – In this event, athletes throw     a heavy weight over a bar that is set higher and higher. The goal is to     clear the highest bar without knocking it down.
Highland Dancing – Traditional Highland dancing     is a big part of the games. Dancers, often dressed in colorful kilts and     tartan patterns, perform dances like the Highland Fling, a quick     and energetic solo dance, and the Sword Dance, where dancers step     carefully around crossed swords.
Bagpipe Music – No Highland Games would be     complete without the sound of the bagpipes. These iconic instruments     provide the music for the competitions, adding to the atmosphere of     celebration and tradition.
