Dutch Republic's flag
Dutch Republic or Republic of the Seven United Netherlands was a republic in Europe that was created by the division of seventeen provinces from the Netherlands on July 22, 1581, when the class assembly of the provinces in the Utrecht Alliance swore the Denial of Denial, rejecting the kingship of King Philip II of Spain. Thus began the Eighty Years' War, which would mark the border between the two countries. The Dutch Republic came to an end after a series of uprisings following the French Revolution of 1783 to 1795. It was succeeded by the short-lived Batavian Republic and then the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1805.
