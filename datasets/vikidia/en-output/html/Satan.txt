Satan, in Christianity, is the opposite of God. Satan deceives people by telling them lies and encouraging them to do inappropriate things. According to the Holy Bible, Satan roams the Earth day and night alongside his demons. Jesus Christ defeated Satan after His resurrection and now Satan and his followers are doomed to Hell. Anyone who is not saved in Jesus Christ will go with Satan.
Satan used to be an angel in Heaven, called Lucifer. He was God's right-hand man. One day he wanted God's powers and planned a revolt against Him. God knew of the revolt and kicked Satan and his followers out of Heaven. God created Hell for Satan and his demons to live in.
