Emperor penguins with a chick
The penguin is a large, flightless water bird. Penguins live in the southern hemisphere, mostly in Antarctica. They catch their food underwater, and raise their young on land.
Penguins have wing bones, but their wings have evolved into flipper-like limbs for swimming. They have a tuxedo-like appearance that helps to keep them safe in the water.
