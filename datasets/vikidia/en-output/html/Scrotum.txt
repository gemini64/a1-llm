The Scrotum, also sometimes called the ball sack, is a part of the body of mammals. Only male humans and some male animals have a scrotum.
The scrotum is located between the legs and hangs under the penis and bottom, and its main function in the body is to hold the testicles.
The scrotum also serves as a heat regulator for the semen. In cold weather, the scrotum contracts towards the body to keep the testicles warm, while in warm weather, it moves them further away from the body, to cool them down.
