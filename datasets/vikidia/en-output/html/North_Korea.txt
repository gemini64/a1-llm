The Democratic People's Republic of Korea or North Korea is a socialist republic on the Korean peninsula. It was founded in 1949 and the current premier is Kim Jae-Ryong, the current President of the Presidium of the SPA is Choe Ryong-hae, and the current SAC chairman is Kim Jong-Un.
The current year in North Korea is Juche 108 (2019).  Their years are calculated differently from Western countries which use the Gregorian Calendar, because they are based upon the year that the founding father of the nation, Kim Il-Sung was born (1912).  This year was known as Juche 1, and every year has been numbered consecutively (in sequence) from that date. North Korean websites, such as kcna.kp, will often show the Juche year followed by the Western year.
