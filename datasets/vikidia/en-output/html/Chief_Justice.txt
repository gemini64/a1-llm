The Chief Justice presides over the highest courts with a judiciary in several states. This term was created under English common law. Some countries with such supreme courts are Bangladesh, Canada, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Ireland, Australia, and the USA. However, the jurisdiction in the UK is somewhat exceptional.
