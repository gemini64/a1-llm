Programme 1910, with Nijinsky and Karsavina
Les Sylphides is a ballet choreographed by Michel Fokine to the piano music of Chopin as orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov.
The ballet has no narrative story, but is a series of pictures depicting white-skirted sylphs dancing in the moonlight with a young poet in a black tunic and white tights.
The ballet was first performed by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes on 2 June 1909 at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. The soloists were Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky (as the poet, or young man), Anna Pavlova, and Alexandra Baldina.
