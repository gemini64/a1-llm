Britney Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American pop singer. Spears won enormous popularity while still a teenager for the high energy of her singing and dancing.

After appearing on various Disney shows, Spears rose to fame as a singer with her albums ... Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops! ... I Did It Again (2000). In 2001 she released the album Britney and starred in the movie Crossroads  which received bad reviews, but managed to raise money. Around this time, she decided to project a less innocent image by dancing with a python at a music awards ceremony.
In 2003 she released his fourth album In the Zone, in which she took more creative control than in the previous ones, the song Toxic being especially successful.
She married a singer-dancer in 2004, and they had two children. They divorced in 2008 due to certain mental problems. Spears lost custody of her children (the right to see and look after them). She later regained half-custody rights with the father, but the issue has been the subject of several lawsuits. She was also during 13 years under the conservatorship of her father, James Parnell Spears, which prevented her from doing certain things like driving or traveling without his permission.
In 2013 she released her eighth album Britney Jean and in 2016 the album Glory, which was well received by critics.
