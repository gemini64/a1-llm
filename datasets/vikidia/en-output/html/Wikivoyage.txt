Wikivoyage is a wiki hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is an online travel guide with information about destinations (countries, cities, etc.) and other travel topics. As of February 2015, the English version has over 26,400 entries. (*)
In 2003, the original project Wikitravel was founded. In 2006, some users created a separate copy of the website (which is called "forking") and named it Wikivoyage. In 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation began hosting Wikivoyage.
