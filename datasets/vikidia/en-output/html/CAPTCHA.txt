What is captcha and why
Passwords are given while passing through the network to ensure security. The password is given in such a way that no one can guess it easily. But special computers or special robots have been created to extract passwords. They keep trying with all possible passwords, until the correct password is found. In order to prevent the robot from entering, a special text has to be read and typed even after giving the password. A real human being who can easily understand but a robot cannot understand that. This method of separating people and devices is called captcha.
