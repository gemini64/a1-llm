Kosovo is non-recognized country in south-eastern Europe. It shares borders with Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia. The capital city is Pristina. Kosovo is not part of the European Union but uses the Euro as its currency. Kosovo is only recognised as an independent country by about half of the countries in the world - other countries consider it to be a province of Serbia.

History

Until 2008 Kosovo was part of Serbia, previously it had been part of Serbia and Montenegro and before that a part of Yugoslavia. Kosovo declared itself independent in 2008.
For centuries Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire. Then during the Yugoslavian period, it was an autonomous province of Serbia. The Kosovo War (1998-1999) resulted in thousands of people being killed and, afterward, the United Nations administration until 2008.

Sights
Tourism is starting to develop in Kosovo although you are still more likely to see international peacekeepers and UN administrators on the streets than regular tourists. Most tourists head to the lively and youthful capital, the beautiful village of Brod in the south, the large but ethnically-divided town of Mitrovica in the north (ethnic tensions here are common) and Peja, in the west, famed for its Ottoman architecture.
Tourists who have Kosovo stamps in their passports may be refused entry to Serbia.
There are two UNESCO World Heritage Site in the country: Decani Monastery, Gračanica, Our Lady of Ljeviš and the Monastery of the Patriarchate of Peć.
