The Wii is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released in November 2006. The Wii is a seventh generation console. The Wii's specialty is group play, with a wide range of games and modes that are simple enough for inexperienced gamers but enjoyable enough for hard-core gamers. With over 101 million units sold, the Wii is Nintendo's second-highest-selling home console, after the Nintendo Switch. The original Wii and Wii Family Edition were discontinued on October 21, 2013, although the Wii Mini was still in production until November 13, 2017. The Wii received positive reviews. For years, the biggest selling point of the Wii was its gesture-based controls, which allowed you to play a sword game by waving your remote like a sword or throw a football by mimicking an overhand throwing motion. The Nintendo Wii console comes with everything you need to play most Wii games, namely the Wii Remote and the Wii Nunchuk. However, there are some games that require the MotionPlus add-on or other Wii accessories like the Wii Balance Board. Some people still use their Wii to stream Netflix or Hulu on their TV. Nintendo just put another nail in the Wii coffin. Nintendo is shutting down all video streaming services for the console at the end of January, according to Netflix. Today the Wii runs on servers provided by Wiimmfi, after the original Nintendo Wii Servers shut down in 2014. Rii Shop also operates as the console's shop after the Wii Shop was discontinued in 2019 by Nintendo. Here in 2024 the Wii continues to intrigue gamers. Despite being over a decade old, its unique gaming experience, affordability, and rich game library make it a tempting choice for many.
