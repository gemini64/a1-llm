Pakistani army killing a Bangladeshi
The Bangladesh Liberation War, also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, was a significant conflict that took place in 1971, leading to the secession of East Pakistan and the birth of the independent nation of Bangladesh. The war was a culmination of long-standing political, economic, and cultural grievances between the Bengali-speaking population of East Pakistan and the government of West Pakistan.

Background


Toggle Background subsection
The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the partition of British India in 1947, which created the independent states of India and Pakistan. East Pakistan, geographically separated from West Pakistan by nearly 1,600 kilometers of Indian territory, felt marginalized in terms of political representation and economic development. The imposition of Urdu as the official language further fueled discontent among the Bengali-speaking population.
