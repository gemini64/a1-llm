A tornado in Oklahoma, United States
A tornado is a tube of spinning air that stretches from a cloud to the ground. When the tube is over water, it is called a waterspout.
The wind in a tornado is very fast, sometimes over 320 km/h (200 mph). When tornadoes hit man-made structures, such as houses, they can cause much damage.
Although tornadoes can happen almost anywhere on earth except Antarctica, most tornadoes happen in Tornado Alley, a region in the central United States.
Tornadoes are measured by the Enhanced Fujita scale (EF scale).
