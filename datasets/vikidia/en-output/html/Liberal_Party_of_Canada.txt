The Liberal Party of Canada is a social liberal party in Canada. It was founded in 1867, and is sometimes called "Canada's natural governing party" as it lead the country for 69 years throughout the 20th century. During the 20th century, it competed with the Progressive Conservative party, but in the 1990s, the Reform Party of Canada was created, which was made up of people who were further to the right then the PCs. The Reform Party then became the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance, in 2000, only to be forced to change its name because it has the unfortunate acronym of "CCRAP". The Reform Alliance dominated Western Canada during the late 90s and in 2000, while the PCs remained the dominant opposition to the Liberals in Ontario and other provinces, allowing the Liberals to remain in power. The two parties merged in 2004, and the Liberals lost the 2006 election due to vote-splitting among the centre-left between the Liberals, the New Democrats, and the Greens. The Liberals would not win another election until 2015, as Canadians had gotten sick of the right-wing policies of the Conservatives, and the NDP had attempted to move to the centre, causing them to lose their momentum and allowing the Liberals to outflank them on the left.
