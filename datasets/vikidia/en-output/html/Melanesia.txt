Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It extends from New Guinea in the west to the Fiji Islands in the east and includes the Arafura Sea.
The region includes the four independent countries Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. It also includes the Indonesian part of New Guinea, the French oversea collectivity of New Caledonia, and the Torres Strait Islands.
Almost all of the region is part of the Southern Hemisphere with only a few small islands that aren't politcally considered part of Oceania lie in the Northern Hemisphere.
