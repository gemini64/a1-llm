USFL logo 2022-present
The United States Football League (USFL) was a professional American football league that played for three seasons, 1983 through 1985. The league played a spring/summer schedule in each of its active seasons. The 1986 season was scheduled to be played in the autumn/winter, directly competing against the long-established National Football League (NFL). However, the USFL ceased operations before that season was scheduled to begin. It was later re-established in 2022 after a long 37 year wait. And after a 2 year revamp the league decided to merge with the XFL. This merger began in 2024, and shared resemblance to the NFL-AFL merger of the 60s. The new league was named the United Football League or UFL for short, and would consist of 4 teams in the USFL, and 4 teams in the XFL. Both league's Conference champions would go head to head in the UFL Championship Game at the end of the season to crown one unanimous league champion.

*Panthers won the USFL Championship in the Original League.
*The Houston Gamblers decided to merge with the Houston Roughnecks from the XFL for the Inaugural 2024 UFL season, and decided to use the Roughneck's name, image, and likeness.
