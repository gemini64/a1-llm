Conservapedia is an online wiki created in 2006 by Andrew Schlafly as an alternative to the supposed "liberal bias" and "discouragement of conservative ideas" he found apparent on Wikipedia.  The website is lacking in coverage of many subjects, but also provides news with a right-wing point of view. (*)   The website is run by several administrators whose duty is to block vandals, who blank pages or add swear words and lies.
