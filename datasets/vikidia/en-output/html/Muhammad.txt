Revelation and expansion of Islam

It was from the habit of Muhammad that he'd go into the Hira Cave, thinking and meditating, till he reached 40 years old. When this age reached, the angel Gabriel went into him from the sky, and told him that he would become a prophet, of what is now Islam. After declaring this to his population, the Quraych tribe, most of people mocked from him, the new believers were too low in amount. They were uniting in one of them's house, secretly sneaking away from their homes in night, thus hiding their faith in public. Weeks later, Muhammad was ordered to start public declarations, with slight positive results, as people began to join Islam in a higher rate than before. Nevertheless, Quyrach noble people found that the extension of this religion would be harmful for their activities, and would threaten their ancestors' religious behaviors. Heavy torturing has been committed, the first persons who died for Islam were Soumayya bint Khayyat, and her husband Yasir ibn Amir, while their son Ammar survived by tricking Quraych people that he had came back into his old religion, which wasn't the case. Several years later, Muhammad's wife Khadija and his uncle Abou Taleb died in the same year, which was therefore named by historians as the year of sorrow, this because the closest persons to him are now dead : in fact, Khadija was giving him internal support from the beginning of his prophet mission, while Abou Taleb was protecting him from Quraych rushes, being one of their most respectable community leaders. His tribe didn't wait too much to start harassing Muhammad and treating his followers in the worst manners for 3 years. Muhammad then decided to go into Madinah, which was called Madyan before. His coming was followed by a huge acclaiming, Madinah becoming then the capital of the new religion. The religion has developed there more and more, along with external conquests and alliances with other tribes. Muhammad then came back to Mecca, where he was ordered to take it back. Leading more than 100,000 men ready to fight, he didn't have to battle, though. Instead, he entered Mecca peacefully, with no blood wasted. Islam went to grow even further, as it also reached Persian and Roman empires. He died when he reached 63 years old, then the era of Khilâfa started, beginning with Abou Bakr Al-Siddiq, to finish with Ali ibn Abi Taleb.
