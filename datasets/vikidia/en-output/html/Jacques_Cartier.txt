Jacques Cartier was a French explorer.
Francis I, the King of France, sent him to explore North America looking for gold and a sea route to Asia.
He made many travels to North America and the St. Lawrence River area in the 1530s and 1540s.
France claimed much land in what is now Canada because of Cartier's explorations.
