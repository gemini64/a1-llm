Northern Cyprus is an island republic in the Northeast Mediterranean near the Turkish coast. It was ruled first by the Ottoman Turks and then by Great Britain. It became an independent republic in 1960. But the Greek and Turkish residents continued to fight. In 1974 a military takeover by Greek army officers favored union with Greece. Turkey occupied the northeast third of the island and in 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was established. Only the country of Turkey recognizes this republic. The United Nations has sponsored talks to reunify the island.
