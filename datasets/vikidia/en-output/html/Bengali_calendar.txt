The Bengali calendar, also known as Bangabd, is a solar calendar used in the Bengal region of South Asia. It has a zero year that starts in 593/594 AD. If it is before Pahela Baishakh, which is the Bengali New Year, it will be 594 years less than the Gregorian AD, or 593 years if it is after Pahela Baishakh. The revised version of the calendar was officially adopted in Bangladesh in 1987 and is now Bangladesh's national and official calendar, as well as the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam. However, the traditional Indian Hindu calendar is still being used among the Bengali community in India and determines Hindu festivals.
