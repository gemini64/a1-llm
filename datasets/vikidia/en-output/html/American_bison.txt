American bison
The American bison (scientific name: Bison bison) is a large mammal found in North America. It is also known as the American buffalo. Historically, this mammal lived on the grassy, open plains of the United States and Canada.
Hunting and slaughter decimated the massive bison herds of the nineteenth century. Cattle diseases also played a part.
Today, bisons are found in National Parks and preserves in the U.S.  Here, they are protected. They have regained some of their numbers lost in the nineteenth century through careful management.
