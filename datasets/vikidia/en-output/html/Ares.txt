Hermes, Athena, Zeus (seated), Hera, and Ares (all named). Side A of an Attic black-figure neck-amphora, end of 6th century BC
Ares was the ancient Greek god of war. He was the son of Zeus and Hera. He is depicted as a god of violent physical contact in war. His sons, Phobos (Fear) and Deimos (Terror), accompany him on battlefield in his chariot. He was not a popular god. His Roman equivalent is Mars. He had many, many lovers and dozens of children. The Stymphalian birds were sacred to him.
