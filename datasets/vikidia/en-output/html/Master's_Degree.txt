A master's degree (also known as an MA) is a postgraduate degree awarded by universities, to a person who has undertaken an extended course of study into a specific subject or an area of professional practice, usually at a very high level of understanding.  In order to take a master's degree, it is necessary to study a lower level degree, like a BA first.  In total, depending on the subject being studied, the time taken to complete both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, can be anywhere between 4 and 6 years.
