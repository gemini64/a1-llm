Haarlem is a city in the Netherlands. It is the capital of the province of North Holland.

Protected cityscape

The old core of the city, the Haarlemmerhout, and the area between the timber and the inner were designated on December 5, 1990 as a conservation area.  It's not just that the city is rich, but the overall picture formed by buildings, streets, squares, canals and bridges. The village Spaarndam has been around since 1971, the state-protected village.
