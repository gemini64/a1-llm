Mooball is a town in Australia, near the upper east coast of NSW. The one thing I love about Mooball is that everything there has cow print! The petrol station, the cafe, even the pub! At the pub they sell the Moo drink (this was a couple of years ago, they might not sell it now, though) which was in a cow print cup and it was alcoholic. It is on the drive to Murwillumbah so when you are going up the coast to Murwillumbah, stop and have a look at Mooball.
