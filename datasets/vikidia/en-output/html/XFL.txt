XFL logo 2023-presentThe original XFL ran for a single season in 2001, as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and NBC spearheaded by Vince McMahon and NBC executive Dick Ebersol. The league later returned 19 years in 2020, but was later canceled during mid-season because of the Coronavirus Pandemic. On August 3, 2020, it was reported that a consortium led by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Gerry Cardinale (through Cardinale's fund RedBird Capital Partners) purchased the XFL for $15 million just hours before an auction could take place; the purchase received court approval on August 7, 2020. The league returned 2 years later in 2023, and played through 1 season. Until in 2024 they merged with the United States Football League to form the United Football League. Each League would consist of 4 teams, and the winners of the leagues would play for the United Football League Championship at the end of the season.

Partnerships


2020 season
The XFL ran test games with community colleges in Mississippi, Your Call Football (YCF), and The Spring League (TSL) during their spring 2019 seasons, to experiment with rule changes. The XFL even had a preliminary discussion with TSL about their league becoming an "Official 'D-League' of the XFL".
In 2019, Stephen Austin's American National Combines conducted the league's "Summer Showcase combines". Austin directed eight Showcases in each of the league's eight team locations in June and the second week of July 2019.

2023 season
Under McMahon's ownership, the XFL explicitly avoided any minor league developmental partnership with the NFL or any other league, so as not to lose control of its personnel decisions. This policy changed in 2022 when the XFL signed a collaboration agreement with the NFL to "experiment with proposed rules, test new equipment and develop prospective officials and coaches and explore new ways to address player safety". Johnson also said that "the XFL specifically designed its schedule to give its players the best chance of latching on with an NFL team in May", while Cardinal stated that "the minor league analogy is valid, that's an important part of this."
The league had a player personnel partnership with the Indoor Football League, with the IFL functioning as its de facto minor league, while it also has a partnership with the NFL Alumni Academy to develop potential players which state that every player graduated from the program has an "opt-in" option for XFL contract. In an interview after the 2023 season Senior Vice President of Player Personnel, Doug Whaley, said the XFL don't know if the partnership with the NFLAA will continue: "We haven’t heard if they’re going to do it again. So we’re waiting to see what they said".
The XFL used American National Combines (ANC) for "supplemental showcase" for players on the "XFL waitlist" for the 2023 season. On March 20, 2023, the league announced it has named ANC as the "official regional combines partner", with the ANC running a year-round scouting event, allowing the XFL to "identify more high-quality and talented players".
The XFL also had a partnership agreement with the Under the Lights Flag Football, an international youth flag football league for boys and girls from kindergarten through 12th grade. The two entities also co-hosted the first-ever Youth Flag Football World Championship in San Antonio, Texas on December 27–30, 2022.
