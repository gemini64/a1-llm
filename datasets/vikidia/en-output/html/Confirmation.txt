Confirmation is one of the Seven Sacraments in Christian religions in which someone's faith is strengthened. In the Catholic Church it is taken after the First Holy Communion whilst in the Orthodox tradition it happens at the same time as Baptism.
During the Confirmation ceremony the confirmand receives the Oil of Crysm, which is a scented and consecrated oil and seven spiritual gifts from the Holy Spirit.
They are:

Wisdom
Understanding
Counsel
Fortitude
Knowledge
Piety
Fear of the Lord
