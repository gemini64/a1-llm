The Yukon is one of the 3 territories of Canada alongside Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.

History

It became a territory in 1898 after it was part of the Northwest Territories. Many people came to live in Yukon after the Yukon Gold Rush in the 1890's. It is also home to Canada's tallest mountain, Mount Logan. It has a population very close to the population of Nunavut (nearly 36,000), but is the smallest of the territories.
