Rosa Parks (1913-2005) was an African-American woman who started the civil rights movement.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott
Rosa Parks's bus was divided by race.
In Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, Rosa Parks got onto a bus. These buses were divided by race, with white people sitting at the front, and black people at the back. If the bus became full, a black person would have to give up their seat. When Rosa was asked to leave by the bus driver, she refused and was arrested.
