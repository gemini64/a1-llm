Case of Gynecomastia in a male
Gynecomastia is the benign enlargement of breast tissue in males. There are lots of different possible causes for the condition, including problems with metabolism, some medications, or simply through a decrease in the production of Testosterone, a hormone produced by the Testicles.
Among boys undergoing puberty, the condition usually resolves itself in 75% of cases, within two years.  However, Gynecomastia can affect males of any age.
Those with Gynecomastia may suffer psychological torment during this time, and may consult a therapist.
