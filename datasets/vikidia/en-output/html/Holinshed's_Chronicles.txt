Historians in the Chronicles
Holinshed's Chronicles were books of many exciting and clever stories about British history.
They were supposed to be true, but often were wrong.
A London printer named Reginald Wolfe planned the books to be a history of the whole world.
Raphael Holinshed was in charge. He lived from about 1525 to about 1580. Many writers worked on the books starting in 1548. The books came out in 1577 and 1587.
Men who wrote plays in the time of  Queen Elizabeth the First like William Shakespeare read these books. They used the lively stories in their plays.
