Flag of Nazi Germany
Nazi Germany (Nazi Deutschland), also known as Third Reich, is an unofficial term of the German state from March 24, 1933 to May 23, 1945.
In literature and historiography, the Third Reich is also referred to as Nazi Germany and Nazi Germany. The latter term is more commonly used
in Soviet literature, but it is not clear, as there are serious differences in political construction and ideology between the fascist regime and the
Hitler regime that Benito Mussolini established in Italy. Although unspecified, it was rumored that Hitler had an affair with his niece, Geli Raubal.
