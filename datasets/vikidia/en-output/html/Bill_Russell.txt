Bill Russell (born February 12, 1934 in Monroe, Louisiana â€“ died July 31, 2022 in Mercer Island) was an American basketball player and coach. He played as a center for the Boston Celtics in the NBA.
Russell comes from the University of San Francisco, with which he obtained two consecutive NCAA titles (NCAA = university championship, generally the last level before the NBA) in 1955 and 1956. Chosen in the draft by the Boston Celtics, an era of gold began, with 11 NBA championship titles in 13 years of his career. It will be the best reign by any team in NBA history. If he revolutionized the defense with his counters, and his ability to take rebounds, he was never the main point of his team's offensive plan. This did not prevent him from immediately reviving his team with his precise passes to teammate leader Bob Cousy. Being the first African-American superstar in the NBA, Russell had to deal with racism emanating from some of his supporters in Boston. His problem was not solved when he became the first African-American player-coach in the history of team sports, in the 1966-1967 season.
Russell retired from playing basketball in 1969. In 2010, Bill received the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
