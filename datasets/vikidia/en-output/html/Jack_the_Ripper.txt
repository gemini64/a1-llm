Jack The Ripper on 13 October 1888.
Jack the Ripper, Whitechapel Murderer or Leather Apron, was an unidentified serial killer.
The relevance given to the case lies in the fact that the crimes were never solved, that the killer has a fictitious name and that the case could have some historical significance (it could even splash the English monarchy of the time). This is why the case of Jack the Ripper is often considered part of British popular culture. The time of the murders coincided with the expansionism of the press, which spread the news, noting the savagery of the acts and increasing expectations.
