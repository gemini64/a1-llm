The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is a hypertext-based information system used on the Internet. (*)  The Internet is a network of networks; a collection of networks all connected together. (*)  Each network is a collection of computers of all kinds. The internet is the collection of physical parts used by the World Wide Web to convey information. The web is the information-sharing system built on top of the internet. The web uses various languages such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (usually abbreviated "HTTP") to exchange information (also called "data"). To use the web, a person has to have a computer with a modern operating system (like Microsoft Windows for example). They need a web browser (software that communicates on the web). The computer also needs a connection to the internet by using an Internet Service Provider (or ISP) and a modem.

History
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web. (*)  It was designed for scientists at leading universities and institutes for sharing scientific information. (*)  CERN never made the web one of their official projects. But time was given to Berners-Lee to work on the concept on his own. (*)  The designed a web browser called "Mosiac". From Mosiac, Andreessen went on to develop Netscape Navigator, a popular graphics-based web browser.
