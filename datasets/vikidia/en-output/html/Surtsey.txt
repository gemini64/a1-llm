Surtsey is an island in Iceland that appeared in 1963 as a result of an underwater volcanic eruption that released smoke, ash and matter that coalesced to form the islet. It is named after a giant from Norse mythology.
It serves biologists and other scientists as a field of study to see how fungi, plants and animals reach new territory and interact with it.
