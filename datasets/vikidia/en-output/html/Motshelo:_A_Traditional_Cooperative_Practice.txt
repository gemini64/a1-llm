Motshelo is a Setswana word that refers to a traditional cooperative system practiced by communities to help each other complete tasks. This system is based on mutual support, where people come together to help one another without expecting profit. (*)  The phrase "mabogo dinku a thebana,'' which means ''many hands make work lighter,'' perfectly describes the spirit of Motshelo. It is a system that promotes  teamwork, sharing, and helping one another.
Motshelo practices can include activities such as Molaletsa, Mafisa, Majako, Letsholo and more. These cooperative traditions are an essential part of Setswana culture, passed down through generations.

Molaletsa: Group Work for a Common Goal
Molaletsa  is a practice where people gather to help one another with tasks like weeding fields, harvesting crops, or thatching roofs. The goal  is to lighten the load and complete the task faster than doing it alone.
In this tradition, after completing the work, the people who helped are rewarded with meals and traditional beer. The practice is not just about getting the job done, it also builds friendships and helps the community grow closer. It was especially important during ploughing season, when the elderly would help one another in the fields.

Mafisa: Cattle Sharing for Mutual Benefit
Mafisa is a system where a wealthy cattle owner lends cattle to those who do not have enough. This is especially helpful for people who need cattle for milk or to use as draught power (for ploughing fields).
The borrower is allowed to use the cattle but can not sell or slaughter them. The lender benefits from knowing that their cattle are well cared for, while the borrower gets to improve their life by having milk and the ability  to plough their fields. Sometimes, the borrower may even receive female calves as a reward from the lender.

Majako: Exchange of Labour for Harvest
Majako is a practice where people exchange labour during the harvest season. If a person did not have a chance to plough their field or if they had small harvest, they would help someone else with their harvest in exchange for part of the crops. (*)
For example, a community member might work in someone else's field to help them gather crops, and in return, they get a share of the harvest. This system helps people reduce costs because they do not need to hire workers to harvest their crops. It also promotes unity and teamwork, as everyone works together to ensure that crops are harvested well.
The Setswana proverb ''setshwarwa ke ntsa pedi gase thata'' means ''helping hands work together to accomplish great things," which sums up the spirit of Majako.

Letsholo: Group Hunt for Important Tasks
Letsholo refers to organised group hunts. These hunts were often carried out when there was a special reason, such as hunting a dangerous animal  like a lion that had been killing livestock or hunting an animal whose skin would be used in ceremonies.
Letsholo is carried out by different Mephato  (*)  (groups of men who have gone for initiation school together). The mephato work together as a team to ensure the safety of the community, its livestock and complete the tasks at hand.

The Importance of in Setswana Culture
Motshelo practices, including Molaletsa, Mafisa, Majako and Letsholo, are  important to the Setswana community because they promote cooperation, social bonding, and mutual support. These practices not only  help individuals complete difficult tasks but also ensures that communities stay united and work together  for the common good.
Despite modern changes in the world, these traditions continue to be an important part of the Setswana way of life. They have even been adapted into modern financial practices where people lend money or resources to help one another, keeping the spirit of Motshelo alive in a changing world.
