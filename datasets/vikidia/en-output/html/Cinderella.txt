Cinderella passes the test of the slipper in an illustration by Gustave Dore
Cinderella is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It was first published in 1697 in his collection of eight fairy tales called Stories and Tales of Past Times.
Cinderella was not original with Perrault. He may have heard the tale from a servant in his house or remembered it from his childhood. The details about the fairy godmother, the pumpkin coach, and the glass slippers were invented by Perrault.
Cinderella has always been hugely popular, not only with children but with adults, too. It has been adapted to ballets, operas, musicals, plays, movies, and television programs.
