The Nintendo Entertainment System
The Nintendo Entertainment System or NES is an 8-bit third generation video game console. It was released in Japan as the Family Computer or Famicom in 1983. It was very popular, and saved gaming from the video game crash of 1983. Nintendo stopped making and selling the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995 in North America,  (*)  and in 2003 in Japan.  (*)  IGN named it "the best console of all time".  (*)

Bundles
There were many different bundles available.

Control Deck
This was the basic machine, it did not come with any games. Later on though, this bundle came with a game.

Deluxe Set
This package came with the NES, a Robotic Operating Buddy (ROB), and two games: Gyromite and Duck Hunt.

Action Set
This package came with the NES, a zapper, two controllers, Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt. Because it was the cheapest bundle, it sold the best.

Competition
Many companies could not make another console because of the video game crash of 1983, so the Nintendo Entertainment System only competed against 3 other video game consoles. These were: Sega's SG-1000, Sega's Sega Mark III/Master System and Atari's Atari 7800.
