At its zenith, it was the largest and most populous of the three presidencies that constituted British India, covering vast regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Bangladesh: The entirety of the country.
India: The states of West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh.
Myanmar: Rakhine State and Tanintharyi Region.
Malaysia: Penang Island.
Singapore: The island nation itself.

Significance and Role:


The economic powerhouse of British India: thriving agriculture and trade.
Calcutta, the presidency's capital, was colonial India's intellectual and cultural centre.
Birthplace of the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, a major uprising against British rule.
Home to renowned literary figures like Rabindranath Tagore and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.
Crucial role in developing infrastructure, education, and bureaucracy in the region.



Controversies and End:
The Bengal Partition of 1905, which divided the presidency based on religion, resulted in widespread protests and fueled Indian nationalism. Famines, poverty, and social unrest plagued the presidency. The partition was abolished in 1947 following the Partition of India, with the territories forming parts of India, Pakistan (later Bangladesh), Burma, Malaysia, and Singapore.
