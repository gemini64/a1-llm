Unicorn
The Unicorn is a mythological animal that generally has the body of a white horse with a single long, twisted horn on its forehead. It represents power, purity, and femininity.
Legends say that only young virgins with pure hearts could approach him. For this reason, Renaissance hunters used women as bait to try to capture it. If the water is contaminated or poisoned and the unicorn dips its horn into it, it turns blue and pure.

The origin of the unicorn idea may have been the "horn" of a Narwhal, an aquatic animal that has a large, single, spiral-shaped tooth. This tooth was long sold as a "unicorn horn" in Europe, from the late Middle Ages to the Renaissance, especially in the 16th century, and was used to provide material evidence of the existence of the Unicorn. The sale of this tooth under the name of Unicorn horn allowed them to confer exceptional virtues on it: in particular, healing powers.
