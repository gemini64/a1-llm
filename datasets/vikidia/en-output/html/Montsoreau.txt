History
Montsoreau is a very old place, which still holds Neolithic and Gallo-Roman remains. The first texts mention a fishing village in the year 600 under the name Restis (Filet). According to archaeological excavations, it seems that at that time a temple or an administrative building occupied the rock of Montsoreau. (*)  It is the Count of Blois, who first (996)  build a fortress on Mount Soreau. This fortress was very quickly conquered by the Count of Anjou, who subsequently modified it and made it impregnable. (*)  It was taken only once in its history, by the King of England Henry II, in 1152. In 1450, John II de Chambes (the first adviser to King Charles VII) bought the fortress from his brother-in-law, destroyed it and built the castle still in place. (*)
