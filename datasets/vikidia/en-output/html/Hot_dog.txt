Hot dog
Hot dog is a type of fast food, which is a sausage put in bread. It is usually served with different fillings, more often with ketchup, mayonnaise or mustard. It can also contain fresh, fried or marinated vegetables, greens, cheese and other ingredients.

History
For the first time in Frankfurt, a butcher started making hot dogs, he called it "Dachshund". In 1871, a hot dog wrapped in bread was sold. In 1901, a man named Dargan was not convinced that this dish could be called Dachshund, but simply Hot Dog.
The 500th anniversary of the Hot Dog was celebrated in Frankfurt in 1987, although the Austrians still claimed that the Hot Dog was of Austrian origin.
