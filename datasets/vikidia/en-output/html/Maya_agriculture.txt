The Maya environment was filled with forests, and there was almost no surface water and terrible soil. Even with these terrible conditions, the maya successfully farmed Maize, Corn, Beans, Squash and Chili Peppers. They did this by building terraces in the mountains, raising earth platforms surrounded by canals in lowlands, draining water, clearing land by cutting and burning the trees down. This, unfortunately, wore out the soil.
