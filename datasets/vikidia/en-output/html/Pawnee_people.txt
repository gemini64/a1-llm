Sharitarish, a Pawnee chief
The Pawnee are a American Indian tribe. (*)  They lived mainly in what is now Nebraska and Kansas. Unlike other tribes of the Great Plains, they were a semi-nomadic (meaning they did not live in one place) people. (*)  During the buffalo hunting season, they lived in tepees so they could follow the herds. (*)  They were a fierce people who used war paint and tattoos to frighten their enemies. (*)  The Pawnee also practiced human sacrifice. (*)  Most often this took the form of ritually killing a young captive girl in a five-day ceremony. (*)  They were one of the earliest tribes to come to the area. Estimates are that there were between 10,000 and 12,000 Pawnee in Nebraska by 1800. They had little to fear from their enemies because they were a large tribe. But smallpox and other diseases reduced their numbers significantly in the early 1800s. They were finally removed to Oklahoma in the 1870s.
