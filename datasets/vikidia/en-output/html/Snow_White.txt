Snow White is a German fairy tale. It was probably told for centuries, but in 1812 the Brothers Grimm published a version they had collected in their  Grimms' Fairy Tales.
The story has always been popular with readers and critics. It has been adapted to movies and television, most famously in the 1937 animated musical movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by Walt Disney.
