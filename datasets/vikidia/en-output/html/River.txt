A river is a natural stream of water that flows across land.
Rivers begin with a source. The source may be a spring, a lake, a stream, or a smaller river.
The end of the river is called the "mouth" of the river. The river may flow into an ocean, a lake, or a larger river.
The longest river is usually considered the Nile, but some consider the Amazon River longer. The Amazon River has the most amount of water that flows.
Many cities, such as London on the River Thames, are built along rivers.
