Ashvin is the sixth month of the Bengali calendar, the seventh month of the Hindu calendar, and Rashtriya Shakbda. At the end of autumn, Vedic astrologers see this arrival in the Sun's natural constellation. The last revised calendar, Ashwin, now consists of 31 days instead of 30. This amendment is effective from 16 October 2019
