Snoopy is a character from The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show , the Peanuts comic, otherwise known as the "Peanuts" franchise. It was created by Charles M. Schulz (the creator of Peanuts). He is a black and white beagle with human features and traits and he is also the dog of Charlie Brown (the main character of the show). Snoopy in his made-up stories is a flying ace or fighter pilot. Snoopy is a very loyal dog and always sits with a typewriter on top of his doghouse, clicking buttons almost every day to get inspiration for a story. He is brave, imaginative and a good natured dog with a huge imagination. But Snoopy can be lazy sometimes.
