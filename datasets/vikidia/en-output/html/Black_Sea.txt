Map of the Black Sea
The Black Sea is a sea in Eurasia between Europe, Caucasus, and Anatolia. Many big rivers connect to the Black Sea, like Don River, Danube, and Dnieper River.
It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean ocean through the Mediterranean Sea, Aegean Sea, and two straits: the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. The water is saltwater but less salty than the Mediterranean Sea and the ocean. During the last ice age, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake.

History

In Greek mythology, the Argonauts traveled on the sea. Greeks set up colonies around the sea because it was important to trade for many countries in ancient history. The Gallipoli Campaign during World War I was a fight for access to the Black Sea. It was also important in World War II.

Geology
The Black Sea sits on continental plates which have subsided. It is a geologic basin, and therefore is a genuine inland sea. (*)  Its maximum depth is about 2000 metres. The Black Sea is the world's largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume the sea has no oxygen (it is called anoxic water). The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense because less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large river systems, whereas the deep waters come from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean. A part of Ukraine divids this sea.
The Black Sea isn't really black.

Fish
Anchovies are very delicious fish.
