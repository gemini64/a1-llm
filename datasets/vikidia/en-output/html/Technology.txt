Technology is the science of craft, how we make tools. The word comes from Ancient Greek "τέχνη" or "techne" which means "art, skill, cunning of hand", and -λογία, "-logia" which means learning.
Most technology is used to make better technology because we can use tools to make better tools. The first examples of technology are implements used to make fire, or to cut meat, made from different types of rocks, and we can still learn from this today, even though today's examples of technology is computers and mobile phones, and even software such as this page that you are using to learn and share.
Technology sometimes changes what we do as people, but not always - but it always changes how we do things, so it is intimately related to our development as a civilization and what we are capable of doing as a species such as farming, mapping and sailing, flying, or space travel.
