The hand of an ape, the siamang.
Primates are a group of mammals. It is the group to which Humans belongs. Apes, monkeys and lemurs are primates too, which means that they are relatives to humans: in fact, the Human is an ape.
Primates can be recognised (among other things) by the fact that they have a finger placed apart from the other, the thumb, which allows to pinch, and to catch things : instead of paws, Primates have hands.
