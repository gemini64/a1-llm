Trivia
The door to 10, Downing Street, cannot be opened by anyone from the outside.  This is a security measure to prevent people breaking in.  When the Prime Minister or another member of their cabinet wish to enter, a Police officer who guards the gates to Downing Street will alert a member of staff inside the property, to open the door when the person arrives.  Even the Prime Minister has to access the residence in the same way.
