Leonardo da Vinci - Mona Lisa


Art is a creative activity that people do as an expression of their inner feelings. Art is also attractive to other people who admire it. Some art may only be observed, such as paintings or theatre. Other art can be practically useful, such as clay pots made to put food in or buildings created by architecture that people live or work in.
