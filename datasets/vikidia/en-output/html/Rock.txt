A rock is a naturally found solid material. It is made of minerals and other mineral-like things. The minerals in the rocks are different, so there are many different kinds of rock.
The Earth's outer layer is also made of rock. Rock is often covered by soil or water. It can be found in the oceans, lakes, and rivers of the earth.
When scientists study rocks, they call it Petrology.
