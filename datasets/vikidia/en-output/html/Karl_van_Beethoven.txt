A portrait of Karl van Beethoven
Karl van Beethoven (4 September 1806 – 13 April 1858) was the only son of Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven and Johanna van Beethoven. Karl was also the only nephew of the well-known composer Ludwig van Beethoven. He is most known for being at the heart of a difficult custody dispute between his mother and famous uncle following his father's death.

Early life
Karl was the grandson of Johann van Beethoven, who was a musician, teacher, and singer from Flemish-German descent. Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich and had seven children. Among them, three lived to adulthood: Ludwig, Kaspar Anton Karl, and Nikolaus Johann.
Karl's mother, Johanna Reiß, was six months pregnant with him when she married Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven on May 25, 1806. Karl was born three months later on September 4, 1806. (*)

Custody battle
Beethoven in 1818
After Kaspar's death in 1815, Ludwig fought for sole custody of Karl from Johanna, leading to legal battles until 1820. Karl became a ward of both Johanna and Ludwig, but Ludwig secured sole guardianship in 1816. Ludwig's strict control and enrollment of Karl in various schools caused a deterioration in Karl's behavior.
Johanna sued Ludwig three times for custody in 1818, but her attempts failed. Despite reports of Karl's misconduct in December, Ludwig, referring to him as "My son," remained caring. The Vienna Magistrate granted custody to Johanna in September 1819, citing Karl's unstable life. Ludwig appealed, and in April 1820, joint guardianship with Karl Peters was reinstated.
Johanna's appeal to the Emperor failed, and Karl returned to the Blöchlinger Institute. In 1825, Johann highlighted Ludwig's sacrifices in a letter. Karl's life improved at the University of Vienna at 19, where he displayed business talent despite Ludwig's watchful eye.

Suicide attempt
In July 1826, Karl's desire for a military career angered his uncle Ludwig. Distressed, Karl attempted suicide with pistols in Baden bei Wien. The first shot missed, and the second grazed his temple. Discovered the next day, Karl asked to go to his mother's house, blaming his uncle for his troubles. After the attempt, he received counseling, then traveled to Bohemia for military service with Ludwig's permission.
Before Karl left, Ludwig's health worsened. Karl stayed by his bedside until December 1826. The day after Karl departed, Ludwig, foreseeing his death, left his entire estate to Karl in his will. While in the military, Karl covered his attempted suicide scar. Ludwig van Beethoven died on 26 March 1827, and Karl returned three days later for the funeral.

Later years and death
Karl retired from the military in 1832 and married Caroline Barbara Charlotte Naske. They had four daughters: Karoline Johanna, Marie Anna, Gabriele, and Hermine, along with one son, Ludwig Johann. Despite attempting to manage agricultural lands for a living, Karl and Caroline lived comfortably due to inheritance from his uncles. Karl died from liver disease at 51 on 13 April 1858 and was buried on 15 April 1858 in Vienna's Schmelz cemetery. His wife, Caroline, died at 83 on 15 November 1891.
On 20 April 1903, Karl's grave was opened, revealing his well-preserved, tall body with full snow-white hair. His remains, along with his wife's and her granddaughter Eugenie Weidinger, were transferred to the Dornbach cemetery.
