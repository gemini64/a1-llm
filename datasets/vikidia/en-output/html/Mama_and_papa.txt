Mama and papa are a case of false cognates (words which are similar but do not have the same origin). In many languages, sequences of sounds similar to /mama/ and /papa/ mean "mother" and "father", but not always in that order.
They are the easiest words to pronounce and are usually the first sounds made by babies when babbling.
