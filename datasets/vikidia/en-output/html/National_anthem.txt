A National anthem is the national song or hymn of a country, used to officially recognise it.  It is meant to make people proud of their country, and respect it.
People will often sing the national anthem of a country at sporting events, such as Football matches or the Olympic games.    Some national anthems have no words, like the Spanish Marcha Real.
