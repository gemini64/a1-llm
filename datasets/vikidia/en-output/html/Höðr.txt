Loki tricks Höðr into striking Baldr.
Höðr, or Hǫðr (English: Hod or Hodur) in Norse mythology, is the son of the gods Odin and Frigg, and the blind brother of Baldr. Deceived by Loki he ends up striking Baldr with an arrow made of Mistletoe, causing his death. Váli, brother of Baldr and Höðr will kill the latter to avenge his dead brother. Höðr is destined to return after the Ragnarök, as the god of the new regenerated world.
