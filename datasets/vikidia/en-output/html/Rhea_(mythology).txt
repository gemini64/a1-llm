Rhea was the titaness daughter of Gaia and Ouranos. She married Kronos and bore him six children. The first five (Hestia, Hera, Demeter, Hades, and Poseidon) were devoured by Kronos. Therefore, Rhea hid her last child, Zeus, and fed Kronos a rock. This led to the gods overthrowing the titans and Kronos being thrown into the abyss. From there, Rhea disappears from mythology and it is never said where she went.
