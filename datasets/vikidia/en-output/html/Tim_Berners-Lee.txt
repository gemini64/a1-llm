Tim Berners-Lee, April 2009
Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee  (*)  (born 8 June 1955), (*)  is a British computer scientist who is best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, Berners-Lee, a graduate of Oxford University, made a proposal for an information sharing system while working at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. (*)  His proposal was not accepted as a project for CERN. However, he was given time to work on the project on his own. (*)  In 1990 he wrote the first web page and others were invited to join in and create web pages using his software.

Life
He was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. (*)  He attended Emanuel School, then went to Queenâ€™s College, Oxford University. (*)  He described the concept of hypertext used on an internetwork (internet) to share information within a company and also globally. He called it the World Wide Web. The idea was not an immediate success. With the help of CERN computer scientist Robert Cailliau and others he continued to develop the idea. By 1990 the first web page had been written. Others were invited to participate and create web pages. As the web grew, Berners-Lee decided everyone should be able to participate and without paying any fees.
Berners-Lee's contributions to the World Wide Web did not make him rich, like Microsoft founder Bill Gates. (*)  To make sure the web remained accessible without royalties or fees, in 1994 he formed the World Wide Web Consortium. The Consortium promotes standards and protocols and helps to work out problems between companies who develop web based services and products.

Positions and honors
Berners-Lee is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Web standards organization founded in 1994. (*)  He is a founder and Director of the Web Science Trust (WST) started in 2009. He is also a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation which was also launched in 2009. He is a professor of Engineering at MIT. He is also a professor of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton, UK.
He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001. In 2004 he was Knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 2007.
