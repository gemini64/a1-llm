In the game starting, a text appears and explain the story of a child fallen in the Underground:
Long ago, two races ruled over Earth: HUMANS and MONSTERS.
One day, a war broke between the two races.
After a long battle, the humans were victorious.
They sealed the monsters underground with a magic spell.
