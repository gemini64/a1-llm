Influence of folk culture in our life
People of almost all ethnic groups in Bangladesh celebrate with songs and dances. Dancing for Radha-Krishna is the favorite of Manipuris. This is called gopi dance. In the spring we celebrate Holi with pomp. Like all other ethnic groups in the world, there are different kinds of beliefs among the people of the small ethnic groups in Bangladesh. For example, the night of the full moon and the new moon are of special significance to Manipuri and other Buddhist communities. We also celebrate many religious and cultural festivals on the night of the full moon. On the other hand, Bengali New Year is another festival. All the countries of the world are associated with one or another religion or festival. But this festival has no religious connotation. The festival is especially associated with agriculture and business. On this day all the debts of the workplace are calculated. As a result, day by day it became a festival of universal joy.
