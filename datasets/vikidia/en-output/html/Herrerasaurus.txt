Herrerasaurus.
The Herrerasaurus is a Triassic dinosaur from Argentina and he was one of the earliest theropods.
Some people think it is not at all a dinosaur. The problem is with its bones: dinosaurs normally had 3 vertebrae attached to their hips, but the Herrerasaurus had only 2 of its vertebrae attached to its hip bone. So scientists don't know if this was really a dinosaur.
