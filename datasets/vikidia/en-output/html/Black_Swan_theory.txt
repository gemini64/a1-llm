The Black Swan theory is a philosophical theory in which an unexpected event shakes our understandings of reality.
When the theory was originally proposed, black swans were thought not to exist and the theory was about how seeing a black swan would change someone's expectation that black swans didn't exist. But ironically, black swans were later discovered in Australia when the Europeans first explored the land.
