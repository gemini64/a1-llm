A programming language is a formal language used to write instructions that a computer can follow. It consists of a set of rules (syntax) and meanings (semantics) that allow humans to communicate with computers. (*)

Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages are generally divided into two main categories (*) :

High-level languages: These are easier for humans to read and write. They are further away from machine code, making them more abstract. Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript.
Low-level languages: These are closer to the computer's machine code, providing more control over the hardware but being harder to work with. Examples include Assembly and C.



Popular Programming Languages
Some of the most popular programming languages include: (*)

Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, it is widely used in web development, data science, and automation.
JavaScript: Mainly used for adding interactive elements to websites.
Java: A versatile language used for Android app development and large-scale systems.
C++: Known for its performance and control over system resources, commonly used in game development and high-performance applications.
C#: A language developed by Microsoft for the .NET Framework.
Ruby: Praised for its elegant syntax, often used with the Ruby on Rails web framework.
Go: A statically typed language developed by Google, known for its efficiency in server-side applications.
