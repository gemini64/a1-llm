Fermi
Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901, Rome â€“ 28 November 1954, Chicago, Illinois) was an Italian (later naturalized American) atomic physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1938.
He built the first nuclear reactor in 1942.
He showed how elements can be changed into radioactive forms by shooting neutrons at them.
Fermions are tiny pieces of matter, smaller than atoms and are named after Fermi's ideas.
