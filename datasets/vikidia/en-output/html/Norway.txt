From 900-1349 A.D. The well-known Vikings discovered and settled places like Greenland, Iceland and Newfoundland, and conquered places like the Isle of Man, the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands. After the Black Death, Norway was a part of The Kalmar Union (Norway, Denmark and Sweden), and later, when Sweden went out of the union, Norway was part of Denmark for almost 400 years. In 1814 Norway made its own Constitution, and Norway was allowed to keep it when in union with Sweden. In 1905 Norway became independent again, and after an election, the Norwegian people chose to be a kingdom with the Danish King's son as King. He took the more Norwegian-like name Haakon, and his son took the name Olav. The Queen continued to be Maud.
