Pollution is when something is added to the environment that is harmful or poisonous to people, animals, and other living things. Smoke in the air from factories is a type of pollution as it is bad for the lungs when breathed in. Sewage in drinking water is another type of pollution, as it can make people unwell because it contains germs and viruses. People living next to a building site where there is too much noise can become sick as they cannot sleep or relax. This is called noise pollution.

Air pollution
Air pollution is caused by harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide and very small particles of carbon. Most of the pollution is caused by factories, vehicles and livestock. Today air pollution has become a great threat to human life. People face breathing problems like asthma due to poll.

Water pollution
Water pollution is the presence of harmful materials in water, such as sewage, dissolved metals, waste from farms and factories and crude oil spilled from shipwrecked tankers.
The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilisers, sewage, and detergents. (*)
Pollution causes harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health, and can cause problems such as cancer. (*)
