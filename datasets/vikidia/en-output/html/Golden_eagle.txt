This is an golden eagle
A golden eagle is an eagle.
It is the most widely distributed eagle species in the Northern hemisphere. It occupies areas with natural vegetation, avoiding those heavily impacted by human activities such as cities and agricultural lands. It also avoids forests and prefers open areas, meaning zones with few or low vegetation as that's where it can best hunt.
