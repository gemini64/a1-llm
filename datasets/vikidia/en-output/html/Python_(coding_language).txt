Python is a high level programming language used by many people. (*)  Unlike many programming languages, python uses space (called "indents") for knowing when to repeat code and when to only run certain code if something is true. (*)

History
Python, first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It was created as a successor to the ABC language and aimed to prioritize code readability and simplicity. (*)  Over time, Python has grown in popularity due to its versatility, being used in various domains like web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
The release of Python 2 in 2000 introduced many new features and improvements, but the language transitioned to Python 3 in 2008, which brought significant changes to improve consistency and future-proof the language. (*)  As of today, Python continues to be one of the most widely used programming languages across different industries.
