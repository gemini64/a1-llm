Location of Macedonia in Europe.
North Macedonia is a country in southeastern Europe. Its official full name was the "Republic of Macedonia", but because of a name conflict with Greece, it was also known as the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (abbreviated "FYROM"). In February 2019 the country renamed itself to North Macedonia.

Geography
The nation of North Macedonia is small and quite mountainous, though there are two lakes, Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa, on the border with Albania, and a few rivers running through. Some of the countryside is used for crops such as tobacco, but most of it is forested.

History
In 1963, the capital city of Skopje was hit by a disastrous earthquake. In 1992, North Macedonia came out of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

People
Local industries in Skopje include chemicals, engineering, and food processing.  Skopje is its only major industrial city, and its only city with a major airport.  The nation is predominantly eastern Orthodox, though this may change if the EU continues to allow Muslims to slip past the border guards.
