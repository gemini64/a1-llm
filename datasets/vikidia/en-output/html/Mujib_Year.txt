Mujib Year Logo
Mujib Year is the year declared for the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Government of Bangladesh declared the year 2020-21 (March 17, 2020, to March 26, 2021) as Mujib Year. He was born on March 16, 2020, marking the 100th anniversary of his birth. Therefore, it was decided to celebrate 'Mujibvarsha' to celebrate his birth centenary. In addition, March 26, 2021, marks the half-century anniversary of Bangladesh's independence. Therefore, 2020 and 2021 are witnessing two historical moments in the national life of two Bengalis.
