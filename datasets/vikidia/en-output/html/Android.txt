Android is an operating system for smartphones, tablet computers and some computers. Android is developed by Google.



History
Android Inc. was founded in 2003 and was first planned to be in the camera industry but as a result of the camera market not being enough for its goals the company changed its efforts to a operating system that would rival competitors. It was difficult to find people that would invest in the company. After attempting to negotiate deals with other company's such as HTC and Samsung in 2004, Google acquired them for around $50 million. The first Android phone resembled a Blackberry phone, with no touchscreen and a physical keyboard and was released in 2008, and since has gotten mostly positive improvements with different versions. Today 72.32% of phones run a version of Android.
