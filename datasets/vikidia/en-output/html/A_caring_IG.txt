A caring IG or caring individual health care (VIG) is a carer who works in a nursing home, home care, maternity care, mental health care, a rehabilitation center or care for the disabled. You can actually find them at all healthcare institutions, except at hospitals.
A caring IG helps and supports people who are temporarily or no longer able to take care of themselves. Think of the elderly, disabled or women who have just given birth.
The difference between a nurse and a care IG is that a nurse is allowed to work in a hospital and a care IG is not.
In addition, a carer is not allowed to draw blood, put on an IV, and suck things out of the body. A nurse is allowed to do all this, but otherwise a carer does much of the same work as giving medicines and injections
