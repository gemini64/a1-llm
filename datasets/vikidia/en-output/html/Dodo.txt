Painting of a dodo head by Cornelis Saftleven from 1638. It may be one of the last illustrations made of a live dodo.
The dodo (scientific name : Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird. It was native to the African island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.
The dodo was about 3 ft tall, and may have weighed 22â€“40 lb. Little is known about the bird's exact appearance and behavior. The dodo allegedly was discovered by Europeans in 1598. The name, Dodo, means "Ugly, Disgusting Bird".
The dodo was made extinct by passing sailors in the 16th and 17th centuries who caught and ate the bird. Predators also ate the birds and its eggs. The last living specimen was seen in the early 1670s. The most famous dodo is the fictional dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
