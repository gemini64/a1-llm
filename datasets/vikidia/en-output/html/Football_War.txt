The Football War, also known as the Soccer War or the 100 Hours war as a brief war between El Salvador and Honduras from July 14 to 18, 1969, but El Salvador did not withdraw their soldiers until August.
The war was brought to end by the Organization of American States or OAS.

History

While the name (obviously) implies the war was caused by an association football match, the causes go further than just a football match. By 1969, around 300,000 Salvadorans had moved to Honduras. Around this time period, most of the land in Central America was owned by companies, such as the United Fruit Company. This company was anti-Salvadoran and the Honduran government kicked out many Salvadoran settlers as a result of pressure.
In the qualifier for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, both countries had met. In the first match, which was held in Tegucigalpa, Honduran fans taunted Salvadoran players who were trying to sleep in a hotel. Honduras won 1-0. In the next match, which was held in San Salvador, the tables were turned. Salvadoran fans taunted Honduran players trying to sleep. Famously, instea of raising the Honduran flag, a dirty rag was raised instead, and El Salvador won the match 3-0.
The final match was held in Mexico City, and El Salvador won 3-2. As a result of both losses, Hondurans terrorized Salvadoran immigrants, including destroying their homes and even killing them. Believing that the Government of Honduras had done nothing to stop the oppression of Salvadorans, El Salvador declared war. El Salvador had rapidly advanced into Honduras, but because of the OAS, the war had ended, with tens of thousands of deaths.
