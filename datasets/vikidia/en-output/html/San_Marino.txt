History

Traditionally, San Marino was founded by Saint Marinus in 301 CE. Marinus was a Christian stonemason who fled to the hills that make up San Marino to avoid persecution under the Roman Empire.  Before the 19th century most of present-day Italy consisted of small city states like San Marino. When all of the other small states in Italy united in the 19th Century San Marino refused to join and has never been part of Italy.  San Marino remained neutral during World War I and World War II.
After World War II San Marino became the first country to be democratically ruled by a communist party.
