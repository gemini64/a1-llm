Minervarya Dhaka, also known as Zakerana Dhaka, is a type of frog discovered by Sajid Ali Howladar in Dhaka. The frog sample was collected from the area near Ganobhaban and Jatiya Sangsad. This species is closely related to the Bangladeshi jhin jhin frog, the Nepalese tree frog, Pierre's tree frog, the big-legged tree frog, and the Terai tree frog. It is worth mentioning that in 2016, a new species of animal, the Dhakaia frog, was discovered in Dhaka after 150 years.
