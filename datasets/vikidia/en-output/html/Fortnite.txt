Fortnite is an online video game. In Fortnite, players collaborate to survive in an open-world environment, by battling other characters who are controlled either by the game itself or by other players. The single-player or co-operative (played with friends) mode, called 'Save the World', involves fighting off zombie-like creatures. Fortnite first arrived on the scene on July 25, 2017, during its Early Access phase. This makes it over six years old! The game then hit full release on September 26, 2017. That's a lot of battles, builds, and boogies since it first launched.
