Unicode
James and Sue Lloyd-Williams from Sylheti Translation And Research in London.
In 2002, a comprehensive proposal for encoding the Sylheti script proposed as Syloti Nagri script in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) was submitted, involving diverse contributors. The requesters included Peter Constable from SIL International, James and Sue Lloyd-Williams from Sylheti Translation And Research in London, Advocate Shamsul Islam Chowdhury and Professor Asaddar Ali from Sylot Academy in Sylhet, Bangladesh, Mohammed Sadique from the Embassy of Bangladesh in Stockholm, Sweden, and Matiar Rahman Chowdhury from Sylot Academy (UK and Europe) in London. This expert contribution was completed and submitted on November 1, 2002, under the reference WG2 Nxxxx (= US L2/02-388). The proposal aimed to secure Unicode encoding for the script and contained the necessary documentation for consideration by the Unicode Consortium's Technical Committee (WG2). The associated document (WG2 Nxxxx = US L2/02-388) is recommended for a more in-depth understanding of the proposal's details and historical context.

Historical Significance


Kaithi like Administrative Use
Kayasth, Calcutta writer.
Historically, the Kaithi script of Bihar was used for administrative purposes. While the Sylheti script evolved separately, its connections with Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas highlight the region's historical ties and cultural exchanges. It was used to sign land documents and court registries. Kayasth in Sylheti 'Xaiti', means a person who works in the court register and writes official documents. Other popular uses are religious literature and poetry.

Regional Use
Religious literature and poetry.
Historically, the usage of the Sylheti script was concentrated in Srihatta Nagara (Sylhet city). However, with the introduction of printing, the script has proliferated beyond its original confines to encompass the entirety of the Srihatta district, Kachar, Tripura, Chittagong, Mymensingh, and even reaching Dhaka. This expansion signifies its adoption by the Muslim communities across the broader region to the east of the Padma River. In addition to its prevalence among these communities, there exists a distinct Buddhist narrative connected to the Sylheti script. Vikkus, who traversed the Chittagong-Sylhet-Nepal zone, were known to utilize this script in their travels. From a Hindu perspective, Nagar Brahmins, representing the pandits of the Brahmin caste, were practitioners of the Sylheti script. Their usage held cultural and religious significance. Moreover, the script found its place in the religious poetry of the Muslim community. Furthermore, the Sylheti script made inroads into Christian communities, where it was employed for the translation of the Bible. The script played a role in organizing and presenting Christian religious texts in a manner suitable for the linguistic and cultural context of the Sylheti-speaking population.

International Use

The international use of the Sylheti script saw significant growth within the British colonies, particularly propelled by Sylheti sailors of the British navy, commonly referred to as Lascars. As these seafarers traversed the seas in service of the British Empire, they carried with them the books and menuscripts of the Sylheti script, contributing to its dissemination across various colonies. This widespread adoption reflects the script's role as a means of communication and cultural connection among the Sylheti diaspora in different parts of the world during the era of British naval influence. In contemporary times, Christian missionaries have played a pivotal role in transcribing the Bible into the Sylheti script, ensuring its accessibility to the scattered Sylheti diaspora. This effort has been particularly significant for the stranded Sylheti communities in Myanmar, Pakistan, and various displaced diaspora across the globe. The availability of religious texts in the Sylheti script serves not only as a spiritual resource but also as a cultural link, offering a sense of connection and familiarity to those navigating life in diverse corners of the world.

Learning and Preservation


Preserving Cultural Heritage
Understanding and appreciating the Sylheti writing system contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage. It allows for a deeper appreciation of the linguistic diversity within the Sylheti community. The connections of Sylheti numerals with both Eastern and Western Arabic numeral systems add layers of historical and cultural richness, making the Sylheti script a fascinating subject of study and appreciation.

Preservation Efforts
An awareness program by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and MasterPeace Bangladesh.
Given the cultural significance of the Sylheti script, efforts are underway to preserve and promote its use. Various educational resources and initiatives aim to teach the script to new generations, ensuring its continuity. A program promoting social harmony through awareness of the script, along with the Manipuri and Khasi Language initiative, orchestrated by MasterPeace Bangladesh was financially supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

Similarities and Distinctions
