Leaf
The water that comes form the ground together the carbon dioxide reach the green parts of the plant, where they turn in the organic substances,(something GLUCOSE) expelling as wast product a strange "exhaust gas".
why this process happen must energy.
this is the Photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is divided into 2 stages.
Stage 1: The photosynthesis takes place when the raw sap (water and minerals) goes through the lymph channels up to the leaves, true laboratories of the plant, where under the action of chlorophyll (especially substance that gives plants their green color) and the energy of sunlight, carbon dioxide and mineral salts are transformed into phloem sap (sugars and oxygen).
Stage 2: The energy that is stored in the first stage is converted and used by the plant to live, to grow, build leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds.

General formula
6 CO2 (Carbon dioxide) + 6 H2O (Water) + Light â†’ C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 (Oxygen)

Types
The plants are divided, according to the shape of photosynthesis accomplished by them, into three main groups, which have different characteristics: the C3 plants, C4 and CAM.
