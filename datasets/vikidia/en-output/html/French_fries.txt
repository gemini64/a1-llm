French fries
French fries are cubes or parallelograms cut from raw potatos and then fried. Elongated french fries with a border are also widespread in Estonia.
French fries are served warm and generally crispy, but in some cases, french fries can also be soft. French fries are served either as part of a meal or as a separate snack. They are often salted and served with a sauce such as mayonnaise or ketchup. Many street foods are also based on french fries, such as kimchi french fries or french fries with melted cheese and crispy fried bacon.
They can also be made from sweet potatoes.
