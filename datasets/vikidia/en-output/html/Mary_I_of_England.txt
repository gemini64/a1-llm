Mary I, 1554
Mary I of England (18 February 1516 â€“ 17 November 1558) was Queen regnant of England and Ireland from 19 July 1553 until her death. She was the fourth Tudor monarch of England. She was the eldest child of King Henry VIII, and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Her half-brother was Edward VI of England. Her half-sister was Elizabeth I of England.
Mary is known for having executed Lady Jane Grey, a claimant to the English throne. She also returned England to Roman Catholicism in spite of her father's achievement in creating the Protestant Church of England.
Mary was married to the Roman Catholic King Philip II of Spain. He remained in Spain, and Mary rarely saw him. Mary sent almost 300 people to their deaths for having disagreed with the return of the Roman Catholic church to England. As a result, she was called "Bloody Mary". Her reign was troubled and unhappy. She had no children, and was followed to the throne by Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudor dynasty.
