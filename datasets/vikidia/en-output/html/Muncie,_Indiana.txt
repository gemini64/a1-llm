Muncie is a city in the US state of Indiana.  It is in Delaware County, about 60 miles away from Indianapolis.  The city gets its name from a settlement called Muncietown, which was inhabited by a tribe of Native Americans called the Lenape or Delaware Indians, who had come to the area in 1770 and settled along the White River.  They left the area in 1818, after signing a treaty between themselves and the US Government, to leave the area.   They did so, and moved out into the West of the USA.
