Hestia was always the first to receive offerings at every sacrifice in a household. Any hearth of a household was forbidden to go out unless the fire was ritually extinguished and ritually revived. The hearth of the prytaneum was Hestia's official sanctuary. When a new colony was formed, a flame from Hestia's puplic hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement.	7146	Hestia	50	383
The majority of Dutch speakers live in the Netherlands, the northern part of Belgium (Flanders) and Suriname. Those three countries alone have 21,5 million Dutch speakers. Dutch in the Netherlands, Flanders and Suriname is the official language, and is spoken by nearly everyone there. Dutch is also the official language in Suriname where about 60% of the population has it as their mother tongue.	5324	Dutch_language	50	398
Dutch is also spoken in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, and a tiny corner of northern France called French Flanders. Dutch used to be spoken by many in Indonesia, which was a Dutch colony until 1949, but now only the older generation speak it. Afrikaans, one of the languages of European settlers in Africa, is almost completely based on Dutch. In fact, they are so similar, someone could be speaking Afrikaans and someone else Dutch, and they would both understand each other.	5324	Dutch_language	50	478
"The best known example of very old Dutch text is ""Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu"" (""All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for""). It was written around 1100. For a long time, scholars thought that it was the oldest Dutch text, but now an older text has been discovered: ""Visc flot aftar themo uuatare"" (""A fish was swimming in the water"") and ""Gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer"" (""Do you believe in God the almighty father""). If you know German, this should be pretty easy to understand. These were written around the year 900."	5324	Dutch_language	50	609
The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a building in Pisa, Italy. It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical and leans 4° to the ground. The tower was once leaning more and more to the ground, but recently much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again (*) .	4313	Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa	50	455
When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence.	4313	Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa	50	313
"Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer and pianist. He was born on 17 December 1770, and died on 26 March 1827. He wrote one opera, several masses, nine symphonies, seven concertos, 32 piano sonatas, string quartets, and many other works. The ""Moonlight"" sonata and the bagatelle ""For Elise"" are known around the world."	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	323
Beethoven became a pupil of Franz Joseph Haydn, but Haydn wanted Beethoven to compose in the Classical style. This style was becoming old-fashioned. Beethoven wanted to compose in the new Romantic style. The relationship between Haydn and Beethoven grew difficult, and ended when Haydn went to England for a year in 1795.	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	321
Beethoven started to lose his hearing about 1800. He left Vienna for a country village where he came to terms with his growing deafness. By 1814, he was completely deaf. He continued to compose with success, but no longer conducted or performed in public.	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	255
Beethoven was in love several times, but he never married. He and the women he loved were separated by class differences. Beethoven was a commoner, but the women he loved were aristocrats. It was impossible for him to be united in marriage with any of these women. He came into contact with these women through his position as their music teacher.	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	347
"Beethoven's last great works were composed during this study period and show the influences of Bach and Handel. These works include the Ninth Symphony (""Choral""), the Missa Solemnis, the Diabelli Variations, several string quartets, and the ""Hammerklavier"" piano sonata."	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	270
"Beethoven's string quartets and other chamber music are also played in concert halls and at home. His short and easy piano pieces, ""For Elise"", ""Turkish March"", ""Rage Over a Lost Penny"", and the Bagatelles are played by beginning piano students around the world."	841	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	51	262
In 1536, the Act of Union was passed under Henry's rule. This act had a long lasting effect on Wales as a nation. The Act of Union meant that Welsh people were forced to speak English and things such as road signs were translated into English.	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	243
Henry is known to the popular imagination as a jovial but temperamental monarch. He is infamous for having been married six times. Two of his wives, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, were executed for treason. His three children followed him to the throne of England. They were Mary I, Edward IV, and Elizabeth I.	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	313
"Henry was a competent author and composer. He was said to have written the tune known as ""Greensleeves"". Shakespeare wrote a play about Henry. Henry has been depicted in movies several times, notably by Charles Laughton. Henry is buried at Windsor Castle."	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	255
He was one of the sons of Henry VII Tudor and his wife Elizabeth of York. When his elder brother Arthur Tudor died in 1502, he became the heir to the English crown and he succeeded his father in 1509. The same year he married Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile and the widow of his brother Arthur.	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	368
Starting in 1515, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey became his minister. Henry VIII pursued an alliance with France and, in 1520, met with King Francis I, during talks at the Field of the Cloth of Gold (so named because the English and the French displayed their wealth there). But the alliance between France and England failed, and Henry VIII aligned with the Emperor Charles V.	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	369
Henry VIII established the Protestant Church of England after a quarrel with the Pope. In 1529, Henry attempted to obtain the Pope's consent: he wanted to have his marriage with Catherine of Aragon annulled and to marry Anne Boleyn instead in order to have a male heir. The pope refused, and cardinal Wolsey (whose negotiations with the pope failed) was then dismissed in disgrace. In 1533, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared the divorce, and Henri VIII married Anne Boleyn. In 1534, he passed the Act of Supremacy, which meant that the king, not the pope, was the head of the church in England. He then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader. Anyone who refused was punished.	5254	Henry_VIII_of_England	51	703
Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, (*) whose real name is Gustavo Adolfo Domínguez Bastida, was born in Seville on February 17, 1836 and died in Madrid on December 22, 1870 at the age of 33, was a Spanish poet of the Romantic Movement. It should be noted, that the poet gained popularity after his death, when his works were published, and not in his life. Bécquer had noble ancestors.	5358	Gustavo_Adolfo_Bécquer	52	374
His closest family devoted themselves to painting. Even his brother, Valerian Becquer, painted the most famous and renowned works of Gustavo Alolfo Becquer. Although Becquer was interested more in poetry after the death of his parents he also was familiar with paintings and produced small works and sketches.	5358	Gustavo_Adolfo_Bécquer	52	309
He died on the 22nd of December in 1870 at the age of 33 after a winter chill, typical for that time of the year that managed to end his life. Of his personal life, it is known that he married Casta Esteban y Navarro and from the marriage he had three children. During all his life he was changing his home, he lived in Toledo and in Madrid, and more so he had the desire to succeed during his life, and he tried it, leaving Madrid several times, although it ended in failure, definitely he acquired more popularity after his death.	5358	Gustavo_Adolfo_Bécquer	52	532
"Bacquer was born under the reign of Isabel II, ""She of the Sad Fates,"" during which time the Revolution of 1868 also occurred, dethroning the monarch and giving rise to a dispute over who should hold power, creating regents like Francisco Serrano Dominguez, and, later, the restoration of the monarchy with the Italian king, Amadeo I. During his lifetime, the following events also occurred:"	5358	Gustavo_Adolfo_Bécquer	52	391
Alpacas, llamas, vicuna and guanaco are four camelids present in South America; the first two were tamed. Until some time ago it was thought that both the blade and the alpaca derived from the guanaco. The genetic material has been examined, if they confirm that the vigognia is the descendant of the alpaca, the discovery will lead to the reclassification of the alpaca.	9051	Alpaca	52	371
"In Computer science, Cloud computing is when the user can simply use storage, computing power, or specially crafted development environments, without having to worry how these work internally. Cloud computing is the development and use of computer technology on the Internet. It rely on the infrastructure of the internet. (*) It is a style of computing in which IT-related capabilities are provided “as a service”, (*) allowing users to access technology-enabled services from the Internet (""in the cloud"") (*) without knowledge of, or control over the technologies behind these servers. (*)"	5748	Cloud_computing	52	592
Cloud computing utilizes software as a service (SaaS), such as Web 2.0 and other technology trends, all of which depend on the Internet for satisfying users' needs. For example, Google Apps provides common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on the Internet servers.	5748	Cloud_computing	52	336
The majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies. The services are accessible anywhere in the world, with The Cloud appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of consumers.	5748	Cloud_computing	52	331
"As customers generally do not own the infrastructure or know all details about it, mainly they are accessing or renting, so they can consume resources as a service. By sharing consumable and ""intangible"" computing power between multiple ""tenants"", utilization rates can be improved (as servers are not left idle) which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development. It has been enabled by increased high-speed bandwidth which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites."	5748	Cloud_computing	52	565
"In 1960 when John McCarthy expressed his opinion that ""computation may someday be organized as a public utility""The word Cloud was already in commercial use in the early 1990s to refer to large Automated teller machine networks. (*) By the turn of the 21st century, cloud computing solutions had started to appear on the market, (*) though most of the focus at this time was on Software as a service."	5748	Cloud_computing	52	400
Although there have been efforts to match the legal environment, providers are currently dealing with international markets (typically the United States and European Union) by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select their countries. (*) However it raises concerns about security and privacy from individual through governmental level.	5748	Cloud_computing	52	358
A cloud computing provider or cloud computing service provider owns and operates cloud computing systems to deliver service to other people. Usually this requires significant resources and expertise in building and managing the next generation of data centers.	5748	Cloud_computing	52	260
Water is a liquid. It is made from two molecules of hydrogen, and one molecule of oxygen. The chemical formula for water is written as H2O. Thus, water is a compound made up of oxygen and hydrogen. Water is clear, and usually in its purest form has no smell. Water will boil at 212 degrees Fahrenheit [F] (100 degrees Celsius [C]). Water will freeze 32 degrees F (0 degrees C). Water can be seen in oceans, rivers, and lakes.	5414	Water	52	425

Asthma (or Asthma bronchiale) is a disease that causes affects the airways - called bronchi and bronchioles - that are inside the lungs. It causes the tissue inside the airways to swell, and the bands of muscle around the airways to constrict making them too narrow for enough air to pass through and breath normally. Asthma also causes the goblet cells inside the airways to make more mucous than normal, this clogs the airways which are already too narrow during an asthma attack, making it even more difficult to breath.	5791	Asthma	53	523
A person having an asthma attack often makes wheezing sounds when trying to breath, this is the sound of air trying to pass through the too narrow airway. They also have shortness of breath, which means they cannot take a full deep breath; chest tightness which feels like their chest is being squeezed and they may also cough a lot.	5791	Asthma	53	333
Atopic asthma is the most common form of asthma. Atopy is when there are changes in some of the genes a person is born with (genetic predisposition) that makes them much more sensitive (hypersensitive) to environmental antigens - such as chemicals, smoke, dust etc. This hypersensitivity causes their body to react in certain ways, usually a person who is atopic develops allergic rhinitis but they may also get atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma. If a person has one parent who is atopic they have a 50% chance of being atopic too. If they have two parents who are atopic they have a 75% chance of being atopic. (*)	5791	Asthma	53	624
Cough-variant asthma is a type of asthma in which a cough is the main, and sometimes only sign. Cough-variant asthma usually does not cause wheezing or breathlessness and causes a dry, scratchy, mostly nonproductive cough (this means little or no phlegm is coughed up). About 30% of people who have cough-variant asthma will develop typical asthma. (*)	5791	Asthma	53	352
Work related asthma are types of asthma that are caused or made worse by irritants in the environment at a person's place of work. The kind of jobs that may cause work related asthma are usually those in which there is a lot of smoke or chemicals are used. There are different types of work-related asthma (WRA): (*)	5791	Asthma	53	316
1. Occupational asthma with latency: this asthma type is when the signs and symptoms of asthma occur after a period of time (latency) after being exposed to the environmental irritants. e.g.: John starts working at a factory where chemicals are used the first week of January. At the end of March he starts developing the signs and symptoms of asthma. The period of time from when he started the job in January to when the signs and symptoms of asthma started in March is the latency period. (*)	5791	Asthma	53	495
2. Irritant-Induced Asthma (IIA) is occupational asthma without latency: this is an asthma type is when the signs and symptoms of asthma can occur immediately (without latency) after being exposed to the environmental irritants. [[Frank starts a new job working as a janitor where he uses ammonia to clean. After opening the bottle of ammonia and breathing the fumes Frank starts finds it difficult to breath, his chest tightens up and he develops other signs and symptoms of asthma.	5791	Asthma	53	483
Exercise induced asthma (EIA) - also called exercise induced bronchospasm - is the term used to describe asthma cases in which exercise is the main, and many times the only trigger for an asthma attack. If a person already has a form of asthma or they are atopic there is more of a chance of getting EIA.	5791	Asthma	53	304
Asthma can be controlled most often by avoiding contact with triggers and by using certain drugs. Most asthma sufferers carry special medicines around with them. These are called inhalers. The medicine inside the inhaler opens the tubes that go to the lungs. The inhaler is usually used to prevent an asthma attack, or to stop an attack that is already happening.	5791	Asthma	53	363
There are certain types of drugs that can make an asthma attack worse. These drugs include Aspirin, Paracetamol and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Using Beta blockers is dangerous: On of the effects they have is to tighten the airways.	5791	Asthma	53	243
In developed countries like the United States, Canada, Germany etc. it is more common in poor people but in developing countries it is more common in people who are not poor. More than 80% of the people who die from asthma are from low and middle income countries . (*)	5791	Asthma	53	269
As of 2011, 235–300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, (*) and approximately 250,000 people die per year from the disease. Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%.It is more common in developed than developing countries.	5791	Asthma	53	258
The amount of asthma cases reported each year has gotten much higher between the 1960s and 2008 (*) (*) (*) Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world. (*) Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and 5% of people in the United Kingdom. (*) Canada, Australia and New Zealand have rates of about 14–15%.

"The giant panda (scientific name : Ailuropoda melanoleuca, ""black and white cat-foot""), is a bear with black and white fur. It lives in the mountain forests of central China. It eats mostly a kind of grass called bamboo. It is one of the most endangered species on Earth."	1046	Giant_panda	53	271
Giant pandas have a digestive system more like meat-eaters (carnivores) than plant-eaters (herbivores). Pandas must eat 20-40 pounds of bamboo per day to get all the nutrients they need. They pass 16-20 hours every day looking for food and eating.	1046	Giant_panda	53	247
The baby nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. The mother may leave the den to feed for three to four hours, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black.	1046	Giant_panda	53	291
Male pandas live about 20 years. Females live a few years longer. The oldest panda in captivity was Ming Ming. She lived to be 34 years old. There are only a few giant pandas in zoos around the world. It is very difficult for pandas to breed in captivity. The Chinese have built special places in wild areas to shelter and care for pandas. Pandas were once hunted for their skins in China, but it is now against the law to hunt pandas.	1046	Giant_panda	53	435
In the 1970s, China began showing giant pandas in zoos in the United States and Japan as a type of diplomacy. This happened until 1984, when China changed how this was done. Starting in 1984, China would allow zoos to keep the giant pandas for 10 years, but the zoo would have to pay China up to $1,000,000 each year. Also, the zoo would have to agree that any cubs born would belong to China. (*)	1046	Giant_panda	53	397
The giant panda is one of the most endangered species on earth. It is endangered because its living areas and its stands of bamboo are being destroyed to make way for farms, housing, and other human developments. The giant panda is a symbol of China; it is also the symbol of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).	1046	Giant_panda	53	306
Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was the leader of Nazi Germany during World War II. He called himself the Führer (which means leader in German). Hitler caused the death of tens of millions of people because he started World War II. He killed himself in 1945.	5167	Adolf_Hitler	53	271
Hitler was born into a family of six in Austria (not Germany, like some people think). Hitler's father later died in 1903, which caused him to fail his High School Exams. He left school in 1905 with no qualifications. Hitler became interested in Antisemitism. This is the false belief that Jews are either evil or otherwise not as good as other people. This caused him to hate Jews for the rest of his life, which eventually brought about the Holocaust. In 1913, Austria wanted all young Austrian men to join the army. Hitler left for Germany because he did not like the Austrian army.	5167	Adolf_Hitler	53	585
Hitler's actions, teachings, and beliefs that Jewish people were less important than others, lead to the deaths of millions of Jewish people in World War II in concentration camps, while others were attacked and murdered. This was called the Holocaust.	5167	Adolf_Hitler	53	252
The primary waves are the first ones to be received by the seismograph because they are the fastest ones. They are also called longitudinal waves or compression waves as they vibrate the particles of the rock in the same direction of wave propagation. They propagate both in solids and liquids.	7901	Earthquake	53	294
The secondary waves are recorded by the seismograph for the second because they have lower speed to the first and also the transverse, as they vibrate the particles of the rock in the direction perpendicular to that of propagation. They do not propagate in liquids.	7901	Earthquake	53	265
The earthquakes in the sea occur because the epicenter is located on the seabed therefore the seismic waves propagate in the water causing the formation of a giant wave called a tsunami; this wave becomes increasingly high as it approaches the coast.	7901	Earthquake	53	250
For this purpose it is used the Mercalli scale which was conceived by the seismologist Giuseppe Mercalli and is divided into 12 levels of increasing intensity. The Mercalli scale is not very precise; In fact, two earthquakes, despite having the same intensity, can cause different effects depending on where they occur a (city, desert) and the type of buildings that are found there (buildings, earthquake resistant or not).	7901	Earthquake	53	424
The seismic waves are recorded with the 'seismograph' and the seismograms, records showing the seismic waves of different types, and you can get a lot of important information such as. the magnitude and duration of an earthquake or its epicenter (*) .	7901	Earthquake	53	251
There are some measures that the building respects to limit the damage caused by earthquakes in towns: it limits the height of buildings, are built wide streets, you increase the space between a building and the other, they protect or isolate pipelines and chimneys, because they often follow earthquakes to fires, the most suitable construction material is reinforced concrete.	7901	Earthquake	53	378
If blocked by rubble, avoid shouting and, if scarce air, breathe deeply, repair mouth and nose from the dust with a piece of cloth and close your eyes and try a, piece possibly metallic and beat to indicate the presence of people still alive.	7901	Earthquake	53	242

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a children's book by the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. The title is sometimes shortened to Alice in Wonderland. The book was published by Macmillan in November 1865 under Dodgson's pen name, Lewis Carroll. John Tenniel drew the story's 42 black and white pictures. The book was followed a few years after its publication with a sequel (also starring Alice) called Through the Looking-Glass. Both books have been translated into many languages, and adapted to other media such as movies, plays, and television shows.	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	556
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was a young professor of mathematics at Oxford University, England, when the story of Alice began to take shape in his imagination. He had several child friends at Oxford including 10 year old Alice Pleasance Liddell, the daughter of the dean of Christ Church. On 4 July 1862, Dodgson and his friend, the Reverend Robinson Duckworth, took Alice and her sisters, Edith and Lorina, on a five-mile boating trip from Oxford to Godstow on the Isis River. Dodgson passed the time during the journey telling the story of Alice and Wonderland. Alice asked him to write the story down. He did, and gave the manuscript to her in November 1864. In 1863 (and most of 1864), Dodgson elaborated the story until he was satisfied with it. He read the story to other children. They liked it, so Dodgson began preparing his manuscript for publication. He asked the artist John Tenniel to draw pictures for the story. Tenniel drew 42 black and white pictures. Macmillan published the novel in November 1865 under Dodgson's pen name, Lewis Carroll.	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	1053
The story is about a little girl named Alice. She is enjoying a summer day on a river bank with her older sister when a rabbit runs by. Alice runs after him and falls down his rabbit hole. What she finds underground is a world of nonsense and wonders.	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	251
Anything Alice eats or drinks causes her to grow or to shrink. Sometimes she grows so small she is almost invisible, and other times she grows so tall she disappears in the clouds. She meets many odd characters in Wonderland, such as the White Rabbit, the Dodo, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her Cook, and the Cheshire Cat.	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	326
Alice joins a Mad Tea Party hosted by a March Hare, a sleepy Dormouse, and the Mad Hatter. At the end of the story, Alice plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts. A great trial is held to punish the Knave of Hearts for stealing the tarts from the Queen . At the trial, Alice soars to a great height, then suddenly finds herself on the river bank where the story started. Alice's adventures were all a dream.	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	406
The book was hugely popular upon publication, and is still very popular. Another book about Alice called Through the Looking-Glass was published in 1871. This book was also written by Carroll, and was also very popular. The Alice stories have been adapted to stage plays, musicals, animated movies and live-action movies, such as Walt Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Tim Burton's computer-generated animation and live-action movie, Alice in Wonderland (2010).	846	Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland	53	476
Mesopotamia, from the Greek language, means 'land between rivers'. It includes the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, and the fertile land which surrounds them. It is part of the Fertile Crescent. Mesopotamia today is split. Most of it is in Iraq, but parts are in Kuwait, Syria, Turkey and Iran.	5682	Mesopotamia	53	294
The area is often called the 'Cradle of Civilization'. The ancient writing called cuneiform was first used around 3000 BC by the Sumerians. They lived in city-states (a city and the land around it). According to Genesis in the Old Testament, Abraham lived in Mesopotamia before moving to Canaan.	5682	Mesopotamia	53	295
Historically important cities in Mesopotamia included Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Ma-asesblu, the Akkadian kingdom, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the Assyrian empire. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon (who started the Akkadian Kingdom), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), and Tiglath-Pileser I (who started the Assyrian Empire).	5682	Mesopotamia	53	465
Many advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians and Mesopotamians, such as irrigation, (*) and trade by river, and flood control. Mesopotamians had agriculture and domesticated animals, or livestock, from the earliest records. Babylon is probably the first city built by settled people. Mesopotamia also was the place where the wheel was first used. First it was a pottery wheel that was used to make clay pots, then Sumerians adapted it for transport.	5682	Mesopotamia	53	467
Mesopotamia is made up of different regions. Northern Mesopotamia is made up of hills and plains. Seasonal rains, and the rivers and streams come from the mountains. Early settlers farmed the land and used timber, metals and stone. Southern Mesopotamia is made up of marshy areas and wide, flat, plains. Cities developed along the rivers which flow through the region. Early settlers had to irrigate the land along the banks of the rivers in order for their crops to grow. (*)	5682	Mesopotamia	53	476
Mesopotamia has been conquered many times, by many different peoples. It was the heartland of the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. As each new group moved into the region they adopted some of the culture, traditions and beliefs of the people who had come before. It was conquered by Alexander the Great (332 BC), the Parthians (150 BC), the Romans, the Persian Empire, the Arabs (7th century). It is still one of the most fertile (and therefore valuable) parts of the Middle East.	5682	Mesopotamia	53	500
Ancient Mesopotamia begins in the late 6th millennium BC, and ends with either the rise of the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BC or the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century CE. This long period may be divided as follows:	5682	Mesopotamia	53	241
The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story about a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close companion, Enkidu. Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of Uruk. Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods. Firstly, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba, its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish Gilgamesh for turning down her advances.	5682	Mesopotamia	53	516
The second part of the epic is about Gilgamesh's distressed reaction to Enkidu's death, which takes the form of a quest for immortality. Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero, Utnapishtim. The words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the end result:	5682	Mesopotamia	53	366
These artists, before the Renaissance, painted in the style of Greek icons. Their paintings were important to the education of many Renaissance painters, and were to be seen in the churches where the Renaissance painters worked, and worshipped. Often an altarpiece by one of these artists was surrounded by frescoes by the Renaissance painters who lived 150 to 200 years later. A famous Madonna and Child by Coppo di Marcovaldo stood above the altar where Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi painted the walls of the Brancacci Chapel. Giotto, who is thought of as the first Renaissance painter, was educated by Cimabue, one of the great masters of the Late Byzantine style.	5678	List_of_Renaissance_artists	55	674
A star is a luminous celestial body. Stars are giant balls of burning gases, that emit light into the space. They can be seen in the sky, at night, because, during the day, they're hidden by the much brighter Sun. Most of the stars are so far away from us that they can be seen only as tiny points; but one them, the Sun is much closer. It lights and warms the Earth.	2068	Star_(Astronomy)	55	367
in Aztec religion, the Centzonhuitznahua were the 400 gods of the southern stars. Sons of Coatlicue and Mixcoatl, god of the stars and of the Milky Way. Lead by their sister, Coyolxauhqui, they tried to kill their mother, for having giving birth to Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl without their father, but were instead stained by Huitzilopotchli, the last son of Coatlicue, that birth at this moment.	2068	Star_(Astronomy)	55	393
the Ancient Greeks tried to figure patterns in the disposition of the stars. They imagined drawings, called the constellations, that represented figures of the mythology : the Ursa major (Great Bear), for example, represents the nymph Callisto, lover of the god Zeus, and turned into a bear by the jealousy of his wife, Hera, while the Ursa minor (Little bear) represents her son, Arcas.	2068	Star_(Astronomy)	55	387
A boat is a sea vehicle capable of moving on water (rivers, lakes, seas and oceans). Larger vessels are considered a ship, while smaller ones are called boats too. Unlike a raft, a ship, like a boat, has a trough shape that gives it the buoyancy, speed, and strength needed to float and move on and across the water.	13474	Boat	55	316
"The blobfish really is a strange animal. Its weird appearance has gotten it classified on the internet as the ""World's Ugliest Animal"". Furthermore, it is not very well known, and very few people have had the chance to see it in its natural environment."	5148	Blobfish	56	253
This is normal: the blobfish lives near the bottom of the sea, at very great depths: up to 1200 meters! Because of this it's very difficult to observe, and most blobfish that can be seen are those which have been brought up to the surface by fishermen.	5148	Blobfish	56	252
Although the body of the blobfish looks very bizarre when brought up to the surface, it is perfectly adapted to the bottom of the sea. For instance, the blobfish has no swim bladder (the swim bladder is a pouch filled with gas, like a small balloon inside the body most finned fishes; by inflating or deflating the swim bladder, a fish can float more or less high in the water, using Archimedes' principle by varying in density).	5148	Blobfish	56	429
"But at very great depths, the water exerts enormous pressure which would probably burst the swim bladder, most ""normal"" fish therefore wouldn't be able to live this deep. But the blobfish has no swim bladder. It disappeared from its ancestors a long time ago. As a result, they do not fear large pressures and they can therefore live very deep in the ocean."	5148	Blobfish	56	357
Without a swim bladder, one might think that the blobfish does not float, and that it should have to swim relentlessly to stop itself from sinking. The second special feature of the blobfish is that its flesh, that is to say, its muscles, have a gelatinous consistency and are less dense than water. Even though he has no swim bladder, the blobfish can thus naturally float a little above the bottom ocean without having to spend too much energy.	5148	Blobfish	56	446
With his gelatinous muscle, the blobfish is not a great swimmer: it is not very fast and therefore prefers prey that are immobile or slower than it. It is an opportunistic predator, that is to say, it eats whatever it happens to catch. They eat primarily pennatules, sea snails, or crabs. It can also feed on marine snow, a substance that falls permanently on the seabed from the surface.	5148	Blobfish	56	388
Blobfish habits are poorly known, as very few have been observed in their natural environment. However, we often find scars of suckers on larger blobfish. So we think that blobfish, in turn, are eaten by larger molluscs such as squids or octopus.	5148	Blobfish	56	246
Because of its gelatinous and extremely acidic flesh, the blobfish is not edible, so it does not interest fishermen. Yet, paradoxically, it is a victim of overfishing. Fishermen use special nets called trawls to scrape the bottom of the sea and to capture crustaceans such as lobsters. However, these nets do not differentiate in the things they catch and thus capture many other species such as the blobfish.	5148	Blobfish	56	409
A typical dish is the Smørrebrød. This is an open sandwich (one without a slice of bread on top). It is made with dark rye bread, spread with salted butter. It can be topped with almost anything, although it is usually a combination of meat or fish, hard-boiled egg and vegetables.	8672	Copenhagen	56	281

Tallinn is a small gem in the forests and is an intimate and very romantic place. Tallinn has undergone the influence of Finland for centuries, and this is the result that is more similar to the Scandinavian countries and not to the Baltic countries. The tradition of the Christmas tree was born in Tallinn. there is the tomb of Don Giovanni.	8634	Tallinn	56	342
The typical dishes of Tallinn are:The Sült which is a kind of stew accompanied by jelly, the Mulgikapsad which is pork often accompanied by sauerkraut or potatoes, the Verivorst which is a typical Christmas dish with jam and berries, the Marinated Eels which is smoked fish, the Silgusoust which a type of fish cooked with bacon and served with sweet sauce, the Rossolye it is a salad of herring beets in sweet and sour sauce.	8634	Tallinn	56	426
Paris (nicknamed the City of light) is the biggest city and the capital of France. The city has a lot of important monuments like Eiffel Tower. Paris has 2,243,833 inhabitants (2010) and an area of 105,40 km². If suburbs are counted, the population of the Paris area rises to 12 million people. (*)	447	Paris	56	298
Paris is also the center of French economy, politics, traffic and culture. Paris has many art museums and historical buildings. As a traffic center, Paris has a very good underground subway system (called the Metro). It also has two airports. The Metro was built in 1900, and its total length is more than 200 km.	447	Paris	56	313
As the Roman Empire began to fall apart in the West, the Germanic tribe called the Franks moved in, taking it in 464. In 506, their king Clovis I made it his capital. Charlemagne moved his capital to Aachen in Germany, but Paris continued as an important town and was attacked by the Vikings twice. When Hugh Capet became king of France in 987, he again made Paris his capital. For a long time, the kings only controlled Paris and the surrounding area, as much of the rest of France was in the hands of barons or English. During the Hundred Years' War, the English controlled Paris from 1420 to 1437.	447	Paris	56	600
"During the Protestant Reformation, a huge massacre of French Protestants started there in 1572, called the Saint Bartholomew Day Massacre. Paris saw many other troubles over the years of the ""Ancien Regime"" (Old Kingdom), then in 1789, the French Revolution began in Paris, leading to more massacres."	447	Paris	56	300
Paris was the Capital of the French Empire which, as well as France, covered Spain, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, most of Germany and some of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Poland. The Empire ruled by Napoleon was from 1804-1814/1815. The Russian army seized Paris from Napoleon in 1814, and the Prussian army captured it in 1871. The next time it was captured was by the Nazi Germans in 1940. The Allies freed the city in 1944 and it has not since been captured.	447	Paris	56	483
The Eiffel Tower is the most famous sight in Paris, built by Gustave Eiffel in 1889 with 6,300 tons of iron — that means 18,000 pieces of iron and 2.5 million rivets. With a height of 300 meters, for a long time it was the highest tower in the world. Over 6 million people visit it every year. There are three levels that you can visit, and the highest one is 2nd above the ground. It was made for a fair, but the French government wanted to tear it down. With rising popularity, it stayed.	447	Paris	56	490
The Louvre is a museum with very famous, old works of art, such as the Mona Lisa and the Venus di Milo. The building was built as a house for French kings. The Louvre is the third biggestomuseum in the world, with 60,000 square meters of show room. (*) It is the most visited art museum in the world with 0ver five million people visit it each year.	447	Paris	56	349
Because the city of Paris is roughly only six miles across, visitors have a wide range of options when it comes to transportation. While much of the more well-known attractions are in the center of the city and are best experienced by walking, there are many destinations that require other means of transport. While taxis offer a fast and relatively inexpensive means of travel, Paris’ public transportation system offers an enjoyable, stress-free way to explore the city.	447	Paris	56	473
The Paris Métro system was built in 1900 by engineer Fulgence Bienvenüe and architect Hector Guimard. The Métro covers over 124 miles with 300 stations (*) and 16 lines. Servicing over 6 million residents and tourists every day, the Métro was designed to be an efficient and reliable alternative to the congestion of traffic. Every building in Paris is less than 500 meters from a train station, so accessibility is never a problem. The 16 Métro lines are identified by their final destinations. A rider can simply select the appropriate line and take it in the direction s/he wants. The Métro stations are well marked, and there are ticket booths at most entrances.	447	Paris	56	666

Barbie is best known as a toy doll. Starting as just a doll, Barbie became a brand. It is most common in the United States. It is named after a girl named Barbara. Barbara was the toy maker's daughter. Though the brand is most famous for the doll, other merchandise has been created with the Barbie name such as games, movies, videos, clothing, accessories, and books. The clothes and fashion accessories allow girls a taste of high fashion.	6982	Barbie	57	441
"Throughout the decades, Barbie has reflected and encouraged feminine growth in the workplace in the United States and been a miniature model of women worldwide. The doll has been criticized for causing self-image complexes, yet other companies continue to produce similar dolls. (*) ""The Barbie doll is the biggest selling toy in the history of proprietary toy manufacturing."" (*) On average, 172,000 dolls are sold by Mattel each day."	6982	Barbie	57	435
When Barbara was a child, her parents saw she would rather play with paper dolls than dolls, so her mother created the Barbie doll. This information was later thought to be false as Barbara's mother had been contested by someone living near her, that she had created a much similar doll, Lilli, before she had. As there was no proof, Barbie remained. (*)	6982	Barbie	57	354
"Ruth Handler was the creator of Barbie. Her parents were Polish Jewish immigrants. She was the tenth child. Her husband, Elliot Handler was the founder of Mattel in 1945, which is the largest toy company in the world. She originally wanted to name the doll ""Barbara"", after her daughter, or ""Bab's"" after her daughter's nickname. However, both those names were copyrighted."	6982	Barbie	57	373
Barbie was first released on March 9, 1959 at a toy fair in New York after seven years of battling disagreements. At the time, Mattel was the third largest toy company in the United States. Ruth's display of Barbie was housed at the New Yorker Hotel in a hotel room, since so many businesses brought their toys to put on display. She had to halt the projected production that she assumed she would acquire in business orders at the fair. It was a disappointing day for Ruth and Barbie. In March 1959, Barbie debuted as a teen fashion model on television with more positive response leading the way for the dolls popularity rise.	6982	Barbie	57	628
In the 1960s Barbie's friends joined the line up of fashion dolls. Ken was her boyfriend and came to be in 1962. The Ken doll got his name from Ruth's son. Midge was her friend who was a redhead meeting the toy marketplace in 1963, a year after Ken. Allen was Ken's friend. Skipper was her little sister that was produced in 1964. Tutti and Todd were her twin siblings were introduced in 1966. Francie was her adult cousin. In 1967, Francie was changed into the first black Barbie doll causing consumers to believe it reflected the support of interracial marriages. Since this was during Civil Rights' time, she was not very successful. Twelve months later Mattel introduced Christie, the second black Barbie, who was much more accepted. Cara and Julia were also produced as Barbie's black friends. The roles of Barbie evolved as equality for women's rights progressed. The doll started in the 1960s portraying stereotypical female positions like teacher, stewardess, nurse, etc. A series of novels were also written introducing Barbie and her birthplace in the 60's. Bendable legs and swivel hips were introduced on Barbie in 1965. Jack Ryan created them.	6982	Barbie	57	1156
"Hairstyles of the Barbie's in the 1960s were typically the classic bubble-cut hairstyle of the era taken from the First Lady of the early 60's Jackie Kennedy. The Barbie that is worth the most from this decade according to ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys"" is Color Magic Barbie made in 1967. Her hair and costume changes color. If it is complete with its cardboard box, it is worth $4,000."	6982	Barbie	57	387
"Barbie's facial features were changed in 1971 from eyes cutting from the side and smile without teeth to eyes forward and a wide smile exposing teeth. This change occurred to keep current with the times representing a ""forward-thinking peace-and-love generation."""	6982	Barbie	57	263
"The first doctor Barbie appeared in 1973. Cara's boyfriend Brad reached the toy market in 1975. The flip hairstyle was a popular way for Barbie's hair to be styled in the 70's. The Sears' exclusive Dramatic New Living Skipper Very Best Velvet Barbie made in 1970-71 has the highest list price for the decade in ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys"" at $1,500.00."	6982	Barbie	57	355
Hispanic and black Barbies were no longer featured as friends of Barbie's in the 1980s. They had reached the Barbie title in their own right. Magic Curl Barbie made its debut in 1982 feauting both black and white races. The first Asian doll produced representing Hong Kong in 1981 came from a mold with a rounder face and almond shaped eyes. A Japanese Barbie hit the market in 1985 as one of the first other nationalities offered with the collection of International Dolls of the World Barbies following its release. Barbie was made into a pilot in 1989. The doll could be viewed as opening the door for female acceptance in otherwise male dominant careers paving the way with astronaut Barbie debuting eighteen years prior to Sally Ride's first female in space endeavor. The 1980s also began the Holiday Barbie collection. The first one was produced in 1988 and its listed value is $325, which is $700 less than what it was worth in the 1990s.	6982	Barbie	57	945
"Shani, Asha, and Nichelle were produced to offer greater skin tone and facial feature selection to represent blacks more accurately in 1991.A hit single produced by the band Aqua entitled ""Barbie Girl"" climbed charts worldwide in 1997. Also in 1997, Puerto Rican Barbie debuted. Barbie's body measurements changed in 1998 due to consumer demand. Her breasts and hips were reduced and waist was widened. Race car driving NASCAR Barbie hit toy store shelves in 1998 and 1999 foreshadowing the first female race car driver Danica Patrick. Barbie was flashy and wore bright colors in the 90's. 1994's Barbie Snow Princess worth $1100 is the highest listed of the decade in ""Schroeder's Collectible Toys""."	6982	Barbie	57	700
"Since her late mother Ruth could not dip Barbie's hand and footprints in her concrete slab on Hollywood Boulevard in 2002, Barbara her daughter in which the doll was named after did the honors inducting the doll to superstar status. In 2006 a movie, ""The Tribe"" used Barbie to connect with being Jewish in America. In 2008, Barbie was transformed into a representation of African culture for the hundredth anniversary of the first African American sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. 2009 brought about changes to the black Barbie adding fuller lips and altered facial features at the request of consumer complaints. Tricelle was given more textured and curlier hair. Chataine Barbie made in 2003 is worth $425 according to ""Schroeder's""."	6982	Barbie	57	730
Some people believe Barbie gives girls a wrong idea of what they will look like when they grow up. If her doll size proportions were converted into life size body measurements (breast size, waist size, hip size) only 1 in 100,000 women would be able to obtain her figure. Though recent plastic surgery advancements has reduced that gap. Many people believe that the introduction of the Barbie doll was wrong due to the fact it made young girls believe they had to become skinny in order to be just like Barbie. The doll has been blamed for eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. If a girl or woman was Barbie's actual size, she would suffer from back problems due to her breast size. She would also be unable to support her weight on her tiny feet making it impossible for her to walk. She is not supposed to be taken as a literal interpretation of a teenage girl. Barbie was not built to give girls an inferior complex when comparing themselves to the doll. She was built to be a longer lasting alternative to the easily torn paper dolls for hours of enjoyment reinacting life scenes through a child's creativity and imagination. Barbie is a teen doll, which gives little girls a peek at what might happen in their teen life. This was thought to be bad, because Barbie has lots of boyfriends.	6982	Barbie	57	1302
Ruth Handler, Barbie's creator, has been blamed for taking the Barbie doll design from a doll made in Germany in 1955, the Lilli doll that was sold mainly at tobacco shops for men post war. Lilli was originally a cartoon character in a tabloid newspaper in Germany created by Reinhard Beuthein in 1952. O.M. Hausser/Elastolin Company had Max Weissbrodt, a doll maker of theirs get a patent for Lilli's limb design. Ruth is rumored to have purchased a few of the dolls while in Switzerland with her family. The Barbie doll has been in competition with other toy companies' doll designs. Ideal Toy and Novelty Company began making Tammy in 1962, American Character Doll Company challenged Barbie's sales in 1963 with Tressy, and Remco started producing the Littlechap Family in 1964. However, none had the popularity of Barbie. At the time of production, Tammy gave Barbie creators a financial scare. She was based on a movie character played by Debbie Reynolds. Instead of being surrounded with friends and boyfriends, the doll came with a mother and father, which might be why her popularity never surpassed Barbie's.	6982	Barbie	57	1117
Barbie is a very big trend. She has had many sisters, boyfriends, and friends. She has dream houses and clothes. She has many jobs from teacher to doctor to astronaut. There have been many other dolls like Barbie since Barbie was first produced. Barbie also created MyScene dolls, a spoof of Bratz. The fact is the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler, fought sexism and overcame her domesticated gender role to accomplish her goals in the business arena as a female by producing the world-famous Barbie doll.	6982	Barbie	57	504

Hardcore mode is a harder version of survival, where the player is on hard, cannot cheat and cannot respawn after he or she died. When the player dies, the world is deleted. In 1.8, you can now see your world in spectator mode, but you can't change anything.	4641	Minecraft	57	258
The player is about 1.8 blocks tall. There are 2 main skins of the player: Steve (a man with brown hair, light brown skin, blue eyes, a light blue T-shirt, dark blue trousers and grey shoes) and Alex (a woman with long orange hair, a light green T-shirt, a dark green belt, brown trousers and black boots). The skin can then be changed in the options, and you can download skins from the internet or create them.	4641	Minecraft	57	412
The blaze is a mob from the nether. He has a yellow head with yellow rods turning around him, and emits smoke. When he sees the player, he shoots fireballs which burn the player for a few seconds, and can also deals contact damage. It drops blaze rods.	4641	Minecraft	57	252

Working in progress In early 2009, Minecraft was being privately developed by Notch, aka Markus Persson. It was released just 6 days later, in the first phase. Players were only limited to a few blocks and creative mode. Added features in this phase were more about testing.	4641	Minecraft	57	274
This game was originally called Cave Game. This game was different than other online games where you create things because instead of simply creating structures, you also have to gather resources to build those structures.This mix was unusual because most games at the time usually only had the player gather resources and not build or to build but not have to gather resources. On top of that, Minecraft was also a survival game. You have to survive hostile mobs and can explore the vast world. You can also use your resources to craft new materials that you can use to create structures, survive longer, and craft more materials.Updates that occurred after the release was 1.0.0. It was the explorer update that added all the features in the base game, like health and other base features.	4641	Minecraft	57	791

Bangladesh (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ]) is located in South Asia, and its official name is the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It shares borders with India's West Bengal to the west, Assam, Tripura, and Mizoram to the east, and Myanmar's Chin and Rakhine states to the southeast. The Bay of Bengal lies on the south coast of Bangladesh. The country is situated across a significant part of the world's largest delta and is home to more than 170 million people, making it the 8th most populous country globally. Fifty-seven international rivers traverse Bangladesh. Bangladesh's northeastern and southeastern regions are covered with mountains dating back to the Tertiary period. The country is home to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, and Cox's Bazar Beach, the longest natural beach.	1345	Bangladesh	58	821
During South Asia's ancient and classical period, several townships were formed in the Bangladesh region, including Banga, Pundra, Gaur, Gangariddhi, Samatat, and Harikel. This region was a province of the Maurya Empire during the Maurya period. These townships were famous for their naval power and maritime trade. They exported muslin and silk to the Middle East and the Roman Empire. In the first millennium, the Pala Empire, the Chandra Dynasty, and the Sen Dynasty were established in Bangladesh. Islam spread to the region after the conquest of Gaur by Bakhtiar Khalji and during the Delhi Sultanate. Europeans considered Shahi Bengal to be the wealthiest commercial country in the world.	1345	Bangladesh	58	694
During the Mughal period, 12 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) was generated in Subah Bengal, more than Western Europe's GDP. From 1765 to 1947, the territory of Bangladesh was part of the Presidency of Bengal. After the partition of India in 1947, the Bangladesh region became part of the newly formed Pakistani dominions called East Bengal (1947–1956; East Pakistan, 1956–1971). From 1947 to 1956, when Bengali nationalism developed centered on the Bengali language movement, East Pakistan was established as an independent and sovereign nation-state called Bangladesh in 1971 through the democratic and armed struggle with the help of India against the various political, cultural, and economic exploitation, discrimination and oppression of West Pakistan. During the post-independence period, famine and natural disasters occurred in poverty-stricken Bangladesh multiple times. In addition, prolonged political instability and repeated military coups have disrupted the country's overall political stability. The anti-dictatorship movement of the 1990s led to the re-establishment of parliamentary rule in 1991, which continues to this day. Despite all the adversities, Bangladesh's economic progress and prosperity in the last three decades have been recognized worldwide.	1345	Bangladesh	58	1295
Bangladesh is the eighth largest country in the world by population, although it is the 92nd by area. Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world, after six small islands and city-states. This tiny country of less than 56,000 square miles has an estimated (2018) population of over 18 million, i.e., 2,889 people per square mile (1,140 people per square kilometer). Bengali is the mother tongue of about 99% of the country's population; the Literacy rate is about 75.2%.	1345	Bangladesh	58	488
Bangladesh's gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices in FY 2017–18 was Tk 22,50,479 crore (US$ 261.27 billion), estimated to increase to US$ 285.82 billion in FY 2018–19. In 2017-18, the average annual income per capita of the people of Bangladesh was 1752 dollars. The government has estimated that the per capita income in the fiscal year 2018-19 will be $1,956 or Tk 1,60,392. The poverty rate is 20.5 percent, the number of inferior people is 10.5 percent, and the annual poverty reduction rate is 1.5 percent. This developing country has achieved economic growth of 5 to 6.2 percent per annum for nearly two decades and has ranked among the top 11 economies. The expansion of the capital, Dhaka, and other cities is acting as the driving force behind this development in Bangladesh. Central to this has been the rapid development of an ambitious middle class and the emergence of a capable and active entrepreneurial class. Bangladesh's export-oriented garment industry is particularly well-known throughout the world. Workforce export is also one of the country's economic pillars. The World Bank estimates that Bangladesh's economy will grow at an average rate of 6.7 percent per year during the two fiscal years 2018-20.	1345	Bangladesh	58	1242
Situated in the fertile basin of the Ganges-Brahmaputra, the country experiences seasonal floods almost every year, And cyclones are also very common. Pervasive poverty, the main problem of this low-income country, has been controlled mainly in the last two decades. Literacy rates have increased rapidly, and birth control programs have achieved unprecedented success. Besides, Bangladesh has achieved exemplary progress in the international human resource development index. However, Bangladesh still faces some significant challenges, including pervasive patriarchy, political and administrative corruption, economic competition in the context of globalization, and the threat of subsidence as a result of sea level rise due to climate change.	1345	Bangladesh	58	746
Moreover, social division has been created in a new way with an all-acceptable electoral system. The parliamentary democratic system of government is prevalent in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a founding member of South Asian Regional Cooperation and BIMSTEC. Besides, the country is an active member of international organizations such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, World Customs Organization, Commonwealth of Nations, eight developing countries, Non-Aligned Movement, and OIC.	1345	Bangladesh	58	493
"The word Bangladesh was found in the early twentieth century when the term began to be used as a general term through patriotic songs such as Kazi Nazrul Islam's ""Nom Nom Nom Bangladesh Mom"" ​​and Rabindranath Tagore's ""Aji Bangladesh Hridoy To."" In the past, the word Bangladesh was written as two separate words in the form of Bangla Desh. In the early 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term for political meetings, processions, and rallies in East Pakistan. Bengali is a significant name for both the Bengal and Bengali areas. The earliest use of the word is found in the Nesari plaque of 605 AD. The term Vangladesa is also found in 11th-century South Asian manuscripts."	1345	Bangladesh	58	677
The term gained official status during the Bengal Sultanate in the 14th century. In 1342, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah declared himself the first Shah of Bengal. The most common use of the Bengali word to refer to that region began during the Islamic rule. In the 16th century, the Portuguese started referring to the region as Bangala.	1345	Bangladesh	58	329
The origin of Bengali or Bengal words is unknown; It is thought that the modern name derives from the Bengali word of the Bengali sultanate. However, some historians speculate that the word originated from a Dravidian-speaking tribe or group called the Bang or Bang. The Bong people settled in the region around 1000 BC. According to some historians, Bong was the second son of Hind, whereas Hind was the first son of Ham, and Ham's Father was Prophet Noah.	1345	Bangladesh	58	457
"According to another theory, the word originated from Bhanga (Banga), which came from the Austrian word ""Banga,"" meaning Anshumali. The word Bhanga and other words that are supposed to refer to the word Banga (such as Anga) are found in ancient Indian texts, such as the Vedas, Jain texts, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas. The earliest reference to ""Bhangaladesa / Bhangadesam"" (Bengal / Bengal) is aimed at the Nesari plaque of Rashtrakuta Govinda III (before 605 AD), where the account of King Dharmapala of Bhangala is written."	1345	Bangladesh	58	531
The history of Bangladesh, a land steeped in antiquity, unfolds like a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of ancient Bengal, Islamic glory, the Sultanate and Mughal epochs, the colonial era, and the tumultuous journey toward modernity. Nestled in the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the region now known as Bangladesh has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the ebb and flow of cultural tides, and the unyielding spirit of its people.	1345	Bangladesh	58	445
"The annals of ancient Bengal still need to be discovered, with archaeological evidence suggesting human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic age. The region evolved into a crucible of civilization during the Iron Age, with trade flourishing along the deltaic waterways. The famed Mauryan emperor Ashoka left his imprint in the 3rd century BCE, marking the advent of Buddhism in the area.<gallery mode=""packed"" style=""font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;"" heights=""180"" caption=""Ancient Bengal"">"	1345	Bangladesh	58	525
Bengal was a region in South Asia. After divided, Bengal word mostly means the Bangladesh and fewer as West Bengal of India.Map of Bengal (Bangladesh, West Bengal)People in Bengal speak Bengali language and have a rich culture with lots of music, dance, and delicious food. Bengal is known for its beautiful rivers, green fields, and friendly people.	1345	Bangladesh	58	350
The transformation of Bengal into an Islamic stronghold commenced with the Arab traders and the conquests of the Delhi Sultanate. By the 14th century, Bengal became an independent sultanate under the Ilyas Shahi dynasty, later succeeded by the Hussain Shahi rulers. The distinctive blend of Persian and indigenous elements enriched the cultural mosaic of the land.	1345	Bangladesh	58	364
"The Sultanate period, from the 14th to the 16th century, witnessed the Bengal Sultanate's ascendancy as a flourishing center of trade and scholarship. The Husain Shahi and later the Karrani dynasties governed with varying degrees of stability, fostering a synthesis of Hindu and Islamic cultures.<gallery mode=""packed"" caption=""Sultanate period"" style=""font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;"" heights=""180"">"	1345	Bangladesh	58	431
With the advent of the Mughal Empire, Bengal became a province under Akbar's reign in the late 16th century. Dhaka, the present capital, emerged as a prominent center of administration and commerce. The Mughals left an indelible mark on Bengal's architectural and cultural landscape.	1345	Bangladesh	58	283
The 18th century it marked the onset of European colonialism, with the British East India Company gradually gaining control. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 solidified British dominion, and Bengal became the nerve center of British rule in India. The rural economy transformed, with the infamous Bengal Famine of 1770 causing widespread suffering.	1345	Bangladesh	58	345
During the broader canvas of the British Raj, Bengal underwent significant political reorganization. The ill-fated Partition of Bengal in 1905 was met with vehement opposition, leading to its annulment in 1911. The region played a crucial role in the nationalist movement against British rule, culminating in independence in 1947.	1345	Bangladesh	58	330
The tragic bifurcation of Bengal in 1947 along religious lines resulted in the creation of East Pakistan, part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. This seismic event sowed the seeds of discontent that would ultimately lead to the birth of Bangladesh.	1345	Bangladesh	58	253
The years following the partition were marked by economic disparities and cultural differences between East and West Pakistan. Linguistic tensions came to a head with the imposition of Urdu as the sole official language in 1952, leading to the Language Movement and setting the stage for the struggle for autonomy.	1345	Bangladesh	58	314
1971 witnessed the culmination of decades of political and cultural alienation as Bangladesh declared its independence from West Pakistan. The Liberation War ensued, a harrowing chapter marred by genocide and conflict. The valiant struggle culminated in victory on December 16, 1971, establishing Bangladesh as an independent nation.	1345	Bangladesh	58	333
The post-independence era has seen Bangladesh navigating the challenges of nation-building, economic development, and political stability. Despite setbacks, the country has made significant strides in various fields, including agriculture, textiles, and social indicators.	1345	Bangladesh	58	272
The inaugural pages of Bangladesh's post-independence history are inked with the establishment of the first parliamentary era. Following the hard-fought war for liberation from Pakistan in 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as the Father of the Nation and the first President. His leadership was pivotal in shaping the early political landscape, and the country witnessed the drafting of a constitution in 1972. However, this era was tragically truncated when Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members were assassinated in a military coup in 1975.	1345	Bangladesh	58	552
"The demise of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ushered in political turbulence, marked by coups and countercoups. General Ziaur Rahman, one of the military architects of the 1975 coup, ascended to the presidency. Ziaur Rahman, recognizing the need for stability, introduced the concept of ""Bismillah"" in governance, incorporating Islamic principles into state affairs. Though characterized by economic reforms and infrastructural development, his presidency was also marked by a growing military influence in politics."	1345	Bangladesh	58	507
Following Ziaur Rahman's assassination in 1981, his widow, Khaleda Zia, and later, Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, assumed the presidency. The presidential era witnessed a confluence of military rule and sporadic experiments with democracy. However, public discontent grew, culminating in the mass uprisings in 1990, which forced Ershad's resignation and paved the way for a return to parliamentary democracy.	1345	Bangladesh	58	421
The reinstatement of parliamentary democracy in 1991 marked a new chapter in Bangladesh's political narrative. Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, the daughters of the country's founding figures, emerged as formidable political figures, dominating the political landscape. The period saw alternating power dynamics between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Khaleda Zia and the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina.	1345	Bangladesh	58	424
Bangladesh, located in the heart of South Asia, is a true testament to the harmonious coexistence of diverse landscapes, rich biodiversity, and a vibrant cultural tapestry. Bordered by India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south, Bangladesh holds a strategic position in the region. So, let's dive into the intricate details of its geography and explore what makes it a significant player in the region.	1345	Bangladesh	58	456
Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions named after their respective divisional headquarters. These divisions are Barisal (officially Barishal), Chittagong (officially Chattogram), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.	1345	Bangladesh	58	256
Each division is divided into districts (zila), with 64 districts in Bangladesh. Each district is further subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, each consisting of multiple villages. In metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into mahallas.	1345	Bangladesh	58	405
At the divisional or district level, there are no elected officials. The administration comprises solely of government officials. However, direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) for female candidates in every union.	1345	Bangladesh	58	340
Script Source reports the use of 16 languages as predominant, alongside 40 others. (*) Bengali is used as an official language of the country. According to Article 3 of the Constitution, Bengali is the only state language of Bangladesh. Bangla is also Bangladesh's national language. The Bengali Language Promotion Act of 1987 mandated the use of the Bengali language in government activities other than foreign communications and the use of English in dealings with foreign investors. Contrary to earlier perceptions, the diversity is underscored by the presence of a multitude of languages. Ethnologue identifies 36 living languages in Bangladesh. (*)	1345	Bangladesh	58	653
Festivals held in Bangladesh can be divided into two main categories: religious and public. Among the religious festivals, major social events include the Muslim community festivals of Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Milad-unnabi, Shab-e-Barat, Shab-e-Qadr, and Muharram. Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Saraswati Puja, Dola Yatra, etc., are notable among Hindu community festivals. The main festival for Buddhists is Buddha Purnima, and for Christians, it is Christmas. But Bangladesh's most prominent social festivals are two Eids, i.e., Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha. The day before Eid-ul-Fitr is known as 'Chand Raat' in Bangladesh. Small children often celebrate this day by bursting firecrackers. Many sacrificial animals arrive in urban areas during Eid-ul-Azha, and the children are excited. On these two ends, many people leave Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and migrate to their native villages.	1345	Bangladesh	58	906
Besides, Pahela Boishakh is the main among the public festivals of Bangladesh. Folk festivals like Navanna and Paush Parvan are prevalent in rural areas. Apart from this, Independence Day, Victory Day, and Martyr's Day are celebrated on February 21 to commemorate the language movement martyrs.	1345	Bangladesh	58	294
Prehistoric men or prehistoric humans are the first and various people that used to live on the earth during the long period of the Prehistory. They belong to several species and genus, either very different of modern human and several million years's old or very closed to us, which master the language, the fire and tools making, from about one million years ago.	4543	Prehistoric_man	58	365
The scientific discipline that study these far ancestors is called paleoanthropology. It is a recent science, that has developed during the XXth century. Several unexpected and recent discovery enriched this field of knowledge these last years, bringing a new sight on the beginning of mankind.	4543	Prehistoric_man	58	294

William Shakespeare was an English playwright and poet. He was baptized on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, and died there on 23 April 1616. He married Anne Hathaway in Stratford at age 18, and they had three children together: Susannah, and twins Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet died as a boy. Tradition states that Shakespeare fled Stratford for London after being arrested for hunting without permission on a nobleman's estate. There is no evidence to support this report.	647	William_Shakespeare	58	483
Shakespeare spent most of his adult life in London acting and writing comedies and tragedies for the Globe and other theatres. Shakespeare also wrote many poems called sonnets, and other poems that include Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece	647	William_Shakespeare	58	246
He retired to Stratford, bought a house called New Place, and died in Stratford in 1616. Shakespeare is buried beneath the floor of Trinity Church, Stratford. In 1623, all but two of his plays were collected in a volume now known as the First Folio. His resting place in Trinity Church is a major destination for fans and travelers.	647	William_Shakespeare	58	332
Shakespeare's tragedies include Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, and Julius Caesar. His comedies include A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. (*)	647	William_Shakespeare	58	253
It was totally destroyed by Mount Vesuvius' eruption, which also destroyed Pompeii and some other cities built near the volcano. At Herculanum, volcanic mud entirely covered the city, then, they transformed into hard rock, making excavation very difficult.	5633	Herculaneum	58	256
Herculanum's site, just like Pompeii's, was explored and studied by archaeologists since the XVIII century. Today, we can visit the archaeological site, outside or underground, on top of the modern city. Herculanum's name looks like the half-god Hercules's name, because according to the legend he founded the city when he stopped in Italy coming back from Spain. It is located seven kimometers east of Mount Vesusius, in Naples' bay, near Cumes and Pompeii. It was first colonised by Greeks, and later by Samnite people later named Campanians. Herculanum's inhabitants, after roman development and wars against Samnite people, became allies with Romans. In 30 BC, Herculanum is officially recognised as a Roman city.	5633	Herculaneum	58	717
According to some books, Herculanum developed as a seaside resort. It was appreciated by rich Romans, and as a residential city for important families belonging to Roman nobility. They were attracted by the splendid seaside view, the climate and products from the nearby countryside. It developed itself a lot during emperor Augustus' reign.	5633	Herculaneum	58	341

"The name Pakistan means Land of (the) Spiritually Pure in both Urdu and Persian languages. Many South-central Asian states and regions end with the element -stan, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Balochistan, Kurdistan, and Turkistan. This -stan is formed from the Iranian root *STA ""to stand, stay,"" and means ""place (where one stays), home, country"". Iranian peoples have been the main inhabitants of the various land regions of the Ancient Persian Empires now owned by the states for over a thousand years. The names are compounds of -stan and the name of the peoples living there. Pakistan is a bit different; its name was coined on 28 January 1933 as by Choudhary Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who published it in his paper Now or Never. by using the suffix -istan from Balochistan preceded by the first letters of Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir and Sindh. The name is actually an acronym that stands for the ""thirty million Muslim brethren who lived in Pakistan—by which we mean the Five Northern units of India viz: Punjab, (Afghan Province), Kashmir, Sind, and Baluchistan"". Basically the word ""Pakistan"" is made up of two words; ""Pak"" and ""stan"". The word Pak means ""pure"", and the suffix -stan means ""land of""."	1196	Pakistan	59	1225
Pakistan became independent from India on the 14 august 1947 with the guidance of the politician Mohammed Ali Jinnah also referred as Quaid-e-Azam. Because he played a huge role in Pakistan’s fight for independence he obtained the deserved the title of “ father of the nation”. He sadly died a year after reaching his goal, his death was caused by tuberculosis on the 11 September. Every year Pakistan celebrates his birthday (25 dicember 1876).	1196	Pakistan	59	445

History is the study of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past, including records (like books, newspapers and letters) and artifacts (like pottery, tools, and human or animal remains). Libraries, archives and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a historian. A person who studies pre-history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist. A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist. The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography.	5346	History	59	659
People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past. This is called oral history. When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old, some historians recorded everything that they said, so that history would not be lost.	5346	History	59	289
"People in different parts of the world continue to remember events differently, just as in Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were ""barbarian""."	5346	History	59	244

The Greek Theatre at Syracuse.The theatre of ancient Greece is a literary genre. It was at its best from 550 to 220 BC. It was the beginning of modern western theatre, and some ancient Greek plays are still performed today. They invented the genres of tragedy (late 6th century BC), comedy (486 BC) and satyr plays.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	315
The city-state of Athens was a great cultural, political and military power during this period. Drama was at its centre. Theatre was part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. In the Dionysia, the playwrights presented their work to an audience. It was a competition, with a winner and prizes. These two main genres were never mixed: they each had their own typical structure. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote their way of life.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	510
Only men were allowed as actors. The chorus were men, as were the actors and the audience. (*) Technically, they had to be citizens of Athens, which only applied to free-born men plus a few special cases. (*) The actors wore masks, so that the people would know which persona (character) the actor played.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	305
Greek tragedy as we know it was made in Athens some years before 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded playwright. He won the first theatrical contest held at Athens, so he was the leader of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica. (*) Dithyrambs were ancient hymns sung in praise of the god of wine and fertility, Dionysus. They had a wild and ecstatic nature.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	376
"By Thespis' time the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. It had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of this Thespis is often called the ""Father of Tragedy"". The statesman Solon is said to have created poems in which characters speak with their own voice. Spoken recitations, known as rhapsodes, of Homer's epics were popular in festivals before 534 BC. (*) Thespis's contribution to drama is unclear, but his name is remembered in the common term for performer—a 'thespian'."	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	501
Phrynichus was the first poet known to use a historical subject – his Fall of Miletus, 493, told the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. (*) He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	264
Until the Hellenistic period, all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we only have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when repetition of old tragedies became fashion.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	262
After the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persians (Achaemenid Empire) in 480 BC, (*) the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became an even more major part of Athenian culture and civic pride. The centre-piece was the competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus, twice a year. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic version of a mythological subject). From 486 BC, each playwright also submitted a comedy. (*) Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor, and that Sophocles introduced the third. Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	636
Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner. However, as they were written over a century after the Athenian Golden Age, it is not known whether dramatists such as Sophocles and Euripides would have thought about their plays in the same terms.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	410
The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great's conquests in the fourth century BC). The main Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but 'New Comedy', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only playwright from the period whose work has survived is Menander. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	727
"The performance space was a simple semi-circular space, the orchestra, where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra was on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural theatron, (watching place). Later, the term ""theatre"" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené (scene)."	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	340
The theatres were built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Actors' voices needed to be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greeks' understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	371
"In 465 BC, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the skênê (scene). In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to skênê in the theatres. The proskenion (""in front of the scene"") was columned, and was similar to the modern day proscenium."	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	418
Greek theatres also had entrances for the actors and chorus members called parodoi. They were tall arches that opened onto the orchestra, through which the performers entered. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the skênê, the back wall, was two stories high. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	383
Although in the early days the chorus was much larger, the numbers settled down to 12 or 15 in tragedies and 24 in comedies. They usually play a group character, such as 'the old men of Argos'. The chorus offers background information, summaries and comments. In many of these plays, the chorus expresses to the audience what the main characters cannot say, such as their hidden fears or secrets. (*)	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	400
Before the introduction of several actors by Aeschylus, the Greek chorus was the main performer opposite a solitary actor. (*) The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century BC, when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action. Later dramatists depended less on the chorus.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	300
Most of the evidence comes from a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC which depict actors preparing for a Satyr play. (*) No physical evidence survived: the masks were made of organic materials. They were not considered permanent objects, and were dedicated to the altar of Dionysus after performances. There are, however, examples of statues of actors carrying a mask in hand. (*)	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	386
In a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the masks brought the characters' face closer to the audience, as they had exaggerated features and expressions. (*) An actor could appear and reappear in different roles, since the audience did not identify the actor with one character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status. Also, they could show a change in a character's appearance, for example, Oedipus after blinding himself.p70 Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus’ Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides’ The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, a sort of multi-voiced persona or single organism.	4515	Theatre_of_ancient_Greece	60	786
"""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is the national anthem of the United States of America. The words were written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key after the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British. The words were paired with a well known tune by John Stafford Smith first published in 1778. ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" became the official national anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931 by a congressional resolution which was signed by President Herbert Hoover. The anthem is sung or played at State functions, and has become a ritual at American sports events."	3010	The_Star-Spangled_Banner	60	558
"The words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" were written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key after he watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships in Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. His poem was titled ""In Defense of Fort M'Henry"". The poem has four stanzas, but in modern America only the first stanza is usually sung."	3010	The_Star-Spangled_Banner	60	327
"The poem was partnered with a tune composed by John Stafford Smith for a men's social club in London. This tune was called ""To Anacreon in Heaven"". It was already known and popular in the United States. This tune is difficult to sing because it ranges over an octave and a half."	3010	The_Star-Spangled_Banner	60	278

The Colonization of Sri Lanka began with the Portuguese in 1505. It ended in 1948 after the British gave Independence to Sri Lanka. During this period of 443 years, Sri Lanka has been under the rule of Portuguese (1505-1658), Dutch (1658-1796), British (1796-1948) and Trincomalee Harbour was under the French for few months in 1796. Only the coastal areas of Sri Lanka were colonized until the British conquered the whole island in 1815. Until then the inner areas were under the reign of the Sinhala king. Sri Lanka declared Independence on 4th of February in 1948, and became a Republic on 22nd May in 1972.	3567	Colonization_of_Sri_Lanka	61	610
The Portuguese found a port in the area of Colombo and expanded their rough settlements throughout the country in 1517. The result was that the Sinhalese moved their capital to Kandy to prevent further attacks, but inland warfare continued throughout the 16th century under Portuguese control.	3567	Colonization_of_Sri_Lanka	61	293
Sri Lanka went downhill with the Portuguese under control. Many Sinhalese were forced to convert to Christianity, many Buddhists disliked the Portuguese for their cruelty and greediness. That meant that the Sri Lankans would welcome any sort of power to get rid of them. When Dutch explorer, Joris van Spilbergen, landed on the island in 1602, the King of Kandy, Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy, pleaded for help to get rid of the Portuguese.	3567	Colonization_of_Sri_Lanka	61	440
The Dutch went on to fight the Dutch–Portuguese War, which resulted in a Dutch victory. This war occurred because the King of Kandy invited the Dutch to get rid of the Portuguese. When the Dutch came, they were a bigger disaster, with heavier taxes than the Portuguese, and taking of the whole country, except the Kingdom of Kandy, in 1660. This occurred after the falling of Colombo in 1656. The Dutch persecuted many Catholics, but left the Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims alone. There were mixed Sinhalese-Dutch people named Burgher people, who were the legacy of Shabi rule.	3567	Colonization_of_Sri_Lanka	61	577
"During the famous Napoleonic Wars, fearing the French's control of the Netherlands would mean that Sri Lanka would be a French colony, the British took over the country with little difficulty in 1796, automatically naming ""Zeylan"" to ""Ceylon"". In 1802, the Treaty of Ameins temporarily ended hostilities between the French Republic and the United Kingdom during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Dutch part of the island was bequeathed to the British, which then meant the island became an official British Crown colony. In 1803, the British invaded the Kingdom of Kandy in the 1st Kandyan War. In 1815, the 2nd Kandyan War resulted in the end of Sri Lanka's independence."	3567	Colonization_of_Sri_Lanka	61	676
Thunderstorms form from cumulonimbus clouds, moisture, unstable air, and lift. The moisture forms the clouds and rains. The stable air needs to be relatively warm and can rise rapidly. Finally, the lift forms the fronts, sea breezes or mountains.	3780	Thunderstorm	61	246
Donald John Trump (born 14 June 1946 in New York City) is the incumbent President of the United States since 20 January 2025. He previously served as 45th President of the United States from 2017–2021. He is a member of the Republican Party.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	241
Following his father’s footsteps, Trump began a notable career as a real estate developer and businessman. He has written more than fourteen books. His first book, The Art of the Deal, was published in 1987. From 2004 to 2015, Trump hosted and produced the popular television show, The Apprentice.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	297
Trump announced his candidacy for the President of the United States on June 16, 2015. He accepted the Republican nomination in July of 2016. On 8 November 2016, he defeated Hillary Clinton during the presidential election. Donald Trump became the 45th new American president on the 20th January 2017. He has three older siblings and one younger brother. Trump attended the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	481
The work of the Trump Administration included reforming the U.S. tax code; renegotiating trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea; expanding the military; defeating the self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS); responding to the opioid crisis; improving access to healthcare for veterans; responding to the COVID-19 global pandemic; appointing Federal judges, including the nomination of three U.S. Supreme Court justices; and lowering the cost of prescription drugs.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	490
In 2019, President Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for abuse of power by soliciting the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and obstruction of Congress by directing defiance of certain subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives. A trial in the U.S. Senate found the President not guilty of the charges brought against him.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	380
Trump is owner of The Trump Organization. He is married to Melania Trump. Trump had made a few unusual comments during the election, for example he wants to build a wall at the American-Mexican border and wants a shut-down for Muslims entering the USA.	6970	Donald_Trump	61	252

The Minoan civilisation was a civilization on Crete, an island near Greece. It began in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2700 BC, and lasted to about 1450 BC. The Minoan civilisation is famous for its sea trading and well planned cities. The Minoans had an agricultural system which relied mainly on olives and grapes. Their religion worshiped mostly goddesses. The Minoan civilisation was later replaced by the Mycenaean culture.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	429
"The Minoans built houses of stone and brick, but their most elaborate buildings were palaces and shrines of stone. Uniquely in the Mediterranean, the Minoans did not build defensive walls around their cities. Instead, their palaces had many open porches lined with red columns, and many windows to admit the Mediterranean sunlight. They adorned the edges of their roofs with curving ornaments that looked like bull's horns. Each of their palaces centered around a large open courtyard, where they held dances and athletic events. Many of the palace walls were covered with frescoes, or paintings in which the paint is mixed with the plaster on the wall. Some frescoes showed men and women, ships, farmers, fishermen, dancers, nobles, and all sorts of people living very elegant, happy lives. Others showed dolphins leaping in the sea, or imaginary animals like griffins, which are half-lion and half-eagle. Many frescoes show a sport commonly known as ""bull-jumping"", whereby the competitors would try to somersault over an angry bull as it charged around. Whether this practice was religious or a sport is unknown. Some people think it might be mythological and may have never happened at all."	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	1194
The island of Crete was rich in natural resources. They had access to wood, copper, farmland, stone and coastal areas. The Minoans were successful with farming and grew grain, herbs, olives and fruit. Much of the spare food was traded to make money for the island.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	264
The Minoans used a style of writing that scholars today call Linear A. Towards the end of Minoan Civilization a new style of writing began to appear in Crete and elsewhere on mainland Greece. This was named Linear B. Unfortunately there are not enough examples of Linear A to enable us to decipher the script at present. Linear B, however, was deciphered in the 1950s by Michael Ventris who discovered that it was in fact a very early form of Ancient Greek, used at that time by the Mycenaeans. The presence of clay tablets with the Linear B script in Crete suggests the presence of Mycenaeans on the island during that last part of Minoan civilization, though it cannot be said with any certainty in what capacity they were present on the island. It is possible that after the collapse of Minoan civilization the Mycenaeans invaded Crete and took over the island.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	864
"The Minoans wrote their language on long, thin tablets of clay with a stylus or stick. The writing has lots of different symbols, and scholars believe it is a type of writing called a syllabary, in which one symbol stands for a consonant-vowel combination. There are many Linear A symbols that may stand for whole words, though, because many of the tablets were found in storage rooms where the Minoans kept supplies of food, drink and equipment. The tablets which have come down to us exist because they were ""fired"" in the high temperatures created by the fires that destroyed the main palaces of Minoan Crete."	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	612
Because no one knows how to read Linear A, no one knows exactly what the Minoans believed. Because there are so many women in the frescoes on the walls of Minoan palaces, some people think that women ruled the Minoans. It is possible that they worshipped a female god, because there are very few statues of male gods at Minoan archaeological sites, while there are a great many female goddess statues.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	401
One of the most common types of Minoan goddess statue is of a woman, wearing traditional Minoan clothing - the skirt and bodice. However, two snakes twine around her arms, and a bird of some sort perches on top of the crown on her head. Some of these statues are made of pottery; others are made of ivory and gold. They are found at a great many sites all around Crete and on some other Mediterranean islands.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	409
Another god that the Minoans may have worshipped was a sea-god. Many Minoan palaces are adorned with curving shapes of stone that look like the horns of a bull. These horns may represent just the bull, but some scholars believe they mean more than that. The Greeks told stories about a king of Crete who had a very dangerous monster with a bull's head trapped under his palace, and that the monster, called the Minotaur, regularly ate both men and women. Scholars think this may have been a story about a Minoan god who accepted human sacrifices.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	546
Small, basic tribes of people lived on the island from around 6000 BC. They lived this way for thousands of years, until in 2000 BC they rapidly advanced into the first civilization of Europe. The reason for this is not known, but some people think that Egyptians may have traveled to Crete and bought ideas and technology with them. The Minoans were successful because of their farming and fishing - they were not a military power. They also controlled the trade in the Aegean Sea and this made them very rich. Their navy was one of the strongest in the world and because of this they did not have to build walls or towers on their island. The Minoans suffered from natural disasters. The palace of Knossos was destroyed in 1700 BC and rebuilt. Around 1550 BC, the volcano Thera erupted and may have caused a tidal wave which devastated the coast of the Minoan kingdom. From then onwards, their control of trade weakened and they were not so successful. Many people believe that the Minoans were eventually invaded by barbarians who attacked mainland Greece first and then Crete itself. The civilization had died out by 1000 BC.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	1129
In around 1550 BC, a volcano on the island of Thera ninety miles north of Crete erupted, and blew two-thirds of a whole island into ash and flying rock and hot gas. The volcano caused an earthquake, which knocked down many buildings on Crete and killed many people. Afterwards, a tidal wave rolled out from Thera, and washed several miles inland on Crete. The palaces and other monuments of the Minoans were further damaged, many people died during the earthquake and the tidal wave, the Minoans themselves entered a period of decline.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	535
Sometime around 1480 BC, another Civilization from mainland Greece crossed the sea, and invaded Crete. The Minoans were still recovering from the Earthquake and tidal wave, they didn't know that another Civilization was coming to destroy them, they tried to defend the town but the army was still weak they failed, the other civilization conquered the ruined towns and built their own palaces to replace those destroyed in the earthquake and tidal wave. They used the Minoan alphabet to write their own language, called Linear B, and took control of the Minoan towns, fields, and fishing grounds for themselves. Another theory is that the Minoans were not invaded until much later, and had continued to survive, despite not being as successful as before.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	754
There are two famous Minoans in mythology. The first is King Minos, from whom these people and their civilization are named by scholars today. King Minos was believed to be a just and honest ruler, and the ancient Greeks believed that when he died, the king of the underworld made him a judge over the dead. The second famous Minoan is Ariadne, king Minos's daughter, who helped Theseus, a Greek hero, defeat and kill the Minotaur, and later became the wife of the god Dionysus.	4232	Minoan_civilization	61	478
In historical terms, a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time. A historical legacy can be counted in later times as a good thing or a bad thing. For example, the invention of the wheel (for carts, as a potters wheel, as a grinding wheel to help turn grain into flour, and as an early water wheel) in Mesopotamia can be seen as something good. The development of slavery is a bad legacy.	5334	Legacy	61	437
Sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy that will be remembered for a long time. Buddha and Confucius left moral legacies. More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician, Euclid of Alexandria, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements. Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics. In Athens, people voted on what the city would do. This early form of democracy is a cultural legacy.	5334	Legacy	61	467
Legacy is a similar concept as inheritance and heritage. It is something we inherit from past generations and pass to our future generations. Usually heritage refers to material and economical inheritance, while legacy refers to immaterial and cultural inheritance.	5334	Legacy	61	265
The phases of the Moon are the different ways the Moon looks from Earth during a month. Each lunar phase can be identified by the appearance of the moon and the time of the month. As the Moon moves in space, different parts of it face the Sun. This means that different parts of it are lit up. We only see one side of the moon from Earth because it rotates so that one side is always facing us. The same phases happen, again and again, every 29.5 days, approximately. The Moon's phases appear to be a circular disk, which is illuminated to some degree by direct sunlight.	4876	Phases_of_the_Moon	62	571
"A second full moon in one calendar month is usually called a Blue Moon. The saying ""Once in a Blue Moon"" refers to something that does not happen often (like a blue moon). However, a blue moon can also refer to the third full moon in a season with four full moons. (*)"	4876	Phases_of_the_Moon	62	268

Temperature has an effect on density. When the temperature of a substance increases, density decreases because the atoms are moving all around the place having less matter in one space. When the temperature of a substance decreases, the density increases. Many substances follow this rule, but there are exceptions. When most substances freeze, they make crystals that are more dense than the liquid. When water freezes, the water molecules are actually farther apart instead of being closer together. This is because the molecules in an ice crystal are arranged in a way that makes it less dense than liquid water.	7045	Density	62	615
Sometimes people use the idea of density to talk about other properties instead of mass. They're trying to describe how much of a property can be found in a specific piece of what they are looking at. For example, population density is how many people live within the same amount of space. The population density in the city is higher than the country side because there are more people living closer to each other in the city. In computers, storage density is how much data can fit on a data storage device in relation to its physical size. A Blu-ray disc has a higher storage density than a DVD which has a higher storage density than a CD, even though they all have almost exactly the same volume.	7045	Density	62	700
Welding is a way of heating pieces of metal using electricity or a flame so that they melt and stick together. There are many kinds of welding, including arc welding, resistance welding, and gas welding. The most common type is arc welding. Anyone who is near arc welding needs to wear a special helmet or goggles because the arc is so bright. Looking at the arc without visual protection may cause permanent eye damage. It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something like a sunburn. Hot sparks from the weld can burn any skin that is showing. One kind of welding that does not use an arc is Oxy-fuel welding (OFW), sometimes called gas welding. OFW uses a flame to heat up the metal. There are other kinds of welding that do not use an arc.	5201	Welding	63	772
"Use of the electrode varies based on the type of welding process. In SMAW, GMAW, and related welding processes, the electrode is consumed and becomes part of the weld. The electrode is usually made of the same kind of metal to be welded. Because the electrode is consumed by the welding process, the electrode must constantly be fed into the weld. The SMAW welding process features a ""stick"" electrode impregnated with a weld promoter known as flux, clamped to the end."	5201	Welding	63	469
The GMAW welding process features a continuous electrode as a thin wire on a rotating spool. The size of this electrode varies from around 0.635 millimeters to about 4 millimeters. The welding machine has a motor-driven spool inside that feeds the wire electrode into the weld.	5201	Welding	63	277
The TIG welding (GTAW) process features an electrode that is not consumed by the welding process as the metal that makes up the weld does not have any electricity flowing through it. The electrode is made of Tungsten, so used as it will not melt while immersed in the electrical arc. A filler metal, in the form of a rod, can be used to add metal to the weld area.	5201	Welding	63	364
Almost all welding uses filler metal to fill in the small gap between the metal. The extra metal helps to make the weld strong. Sometimes welds need to be made without any filler metal. Welding with no filler metal is called autogenous welding.	5201	Welding	63	244
All types of welding require that the hot metal have protection. Dirt, rust, grease, and even the oxidation of the metal under the weld process can prevent a proper weld joint. As such all weld processes use one of two protection methods: flux, and shielding gas.	5201	Welding	63	263
Welding flux may be used in a solid, liquid, or paste form. During welding, the flux will melt and some of it will evaporate. This creates a small pocket of gas around the weld. This pocket of gas prevents oxidation of the metal under weld. Melted flux, through a corrosive reaction, cleans contaminants that prevent a proper weld. After welding, the flux solidifies. This layer of solid flux is called slag, and must be removed from the weld. The SMAW weld process most commonly uses flux, and is most commonly used on steel.	5201	Welding	63	526
Shielding gas protects the weld by being a pocket of gas around the weld. The purpose of this gas is to keep normal air out, especially oxygen. It is different from flux because there is no liquid on the weld. There is only a gas around the weld. Because there is no liquid, it will not clean up dirt and other things on the metal. This means that the metal has to be clean before it is welded. If it is not, the dirt and other things could cause problems. The gases that are usually used are argon, helium, and a mixture that is 3 parts argon and one part carbon dioxide. Other mixtures of gases can have nitrogen, hydrogen, or even a little bit of oxygen in them. One kind of welding that uses shielding gas is gas metal arc welding. It is usually used in factories to make things.	5201	Welding	63	783
Welding that uses flux is easier to do outside when it is windy. This is because the liquid flux is protecting the hot metal and it will not blow away. Also, the flux is always making the pocket of gas which keeps the electric arc from going out. Welding that uses shielding gas usually cannot be used outside because the gas would blow away if there were any wind.	5201	Welding	63	365
Some kinds of welding do not use an electric arc. They might use a flame, electricity without an arc, an energy beam, or physical force. The most common type of welding that does not use an arc is called gas welding. In gas welding, a flammable(meaning it will burn) gas and oxygen are combined and burn at the end of a torch. Gas welding does not need any special shielding because a flame which is adjusted right has no extra oxygen in it. It is still important to make sure the metal is clean. The flame heats up the metal so much that it melts. When both the pieces of metal are melted at the edge, the liquid metal becomes one piece.	5201	Welding	63	638
The other kind of welding that does not use an arc still uses electricity. It is called resistance welding. With this kind, two pieces of thin metal are pinched together and then electricity is made to go through them. This makes the metal get really hot and melt where it is pinched together. The two pieces melt together at that place. Sometimes this is called spot welding because the welding can only happen at one small place(or spot) at a time.	5201	Welding	63	450
The other kinds of welding that do not use an arc are hard to do, and usually new. They are expensive too. Most of these kinds of welding are only done where specially needed. They might use an electron beam, laser, or ultrasonic sound waves.	5201	Welding	63	242
A lot of electricity is used in arc welding. Some kinds of welding use alternating current like the electricity that buildings use. Other kinds use direct current like the electricity in a car or most things with a battery. Almost all kinds of welding use a lower voltage than the electricity that comes from a power plant. Arc welding requires using a special power supply that makes the electricity from the power plant usable for welding. A power supply lowers the voltage and controls the amount of current. The power supply usually has controls on it that allow these things to be changed. For kinds of arc welding that use alternating current, sometimes the power supply can do special things to make the electricity alternate differently. Some power supplies do not plug into a power plug, but instead generate their own electricity. These kind of power supplies have an engine that turns a generator head to make the electricity. The engine might run on gasoline, diesel fuel, or propane.	5201	Welding	63	996
OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal. This fuel gas is almost always acetylene. Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot, hotter than any other gas. That is why it is used most of the time. Other gases like propane, natural gas, or other industrial gases can be used too.	5201	Welding	63	313
Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld. These kinds of welding can get hot, but they do not make the metal melt. Forge welding is an example of this. Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat. It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge. This seems odd because metals are a solid. this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard. The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit.	5201	Welding	63	520
Many modern countries are on land that was once part of the Roman Empire, including England, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt. The language of the Roman Empire was Latin. The western part of the Roman Empire continued for almost 500 years, and the eastern part including Greece and Turkey, called the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople, continued for about a thousand years more.	5662	Roman_Empire	63	412
In order to control their large empire, the Romans developed important ideas about law and government. Many Emperors had absolute control, and could do as they pleased. When the Emperor died, his favorite friend whom he had adopted as a son often became the next Emperor, since many of them never had sons of their own. After a while, the Emperors grew so weak that the military would just pick one of their generals to be the next Emperor. Many times they would have civil wars to see which general was the most powerful.	5662	Roman_Empire	63	522
The Romans fought many wars against other countries, forced them to speak Latin, and enjoyed watching violent sports. They enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses, and fights between men using weapons. Unlike modern sports, the fighters were often really killed in these fights.	5662	Roman_Empire	63	295
The New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ. During Jesus' life, the Romans who were pagan controlled his country. Later, several Emperors tried to destroy Christianity in any way possible, but they could not. The people were becoming Christian, even though the pagan Emperors called themselves gods. By the year 312, the Emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity, and the next year, a general who followed Christ, named Constantine, defeated the pagans and became Emperor over what was already a largely Christian land.	5662	Roman_Empire	63	579
The city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians, notably in 410 A.D. when the Goths sacked the city. The last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, resigned in 476 A.D. The Roman Empire would last another 1,000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the east	5662	Roman_Empire	63	269
On July 4, 1776, representatives of the colonies (known as the Continental Congress) declared the colonies to be free and independent states and explained their justifications for doing so. Most of the delegates actually signed the document later: on August 2.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	260
During the 1750s and 1760s, relations between Great Britain and thirteen British colonies along the eastern shore of North America became increasingly strained. Fighting broke out in 1775 at Lexington and Concord, marking the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. On January 10, 1776, Thomas Paine published (anonymously) a pamphlet titled Common Sense in which he outlined major problems with the British form of government (a constitutional monarchy) and several reasons the American colonies should separate themselves from Great Britain. Paine's pamphlet both reflected and influenced the growing anti-British sentiment in the colonies.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	647
A painting depicting the signing of the Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull, which hangs in the grand Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States. It shows is the five-man drafting committee presenting their work and depicts most of the eventual signers as being present on this occasion, but this gathering actually never took place.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	343
"On June 11, 1776, a committee consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut (known as the ""Committee of Five""), was formed to draft a formal resolution declaring the colonists' intent. The committee decided that Jefferson — its youngest member and the youngest signer of the final Declaration — would write the first draft of the resolution. After Franklin and Adams made several minor corrections, Jefferson produced another copy. The committee presented this version to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776."	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	643
Independence from Great Britain was declared on July 2, 1776. The full Declaration was rewritten somewhat in general session prior to its adoption by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall). Word of the Declaration reached London the following month, on August 10.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	331
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, 1776, a handwritten draft of the Declaration of Independence was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary to Congress, Charles Thomson. It was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap, who worked through the night to print 150 to 200 copies, now known as Dunlap broadsides. One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	563
On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered a copy be handwritten for the delegates to sign. This engrossed copy of the Declaration was produced by Timothy Matlack, assistant to the secretary of Congress. Most of the delegates signed it on August 2, 1776, in geographic order of their colonies from north to south, though some delegates were not present and had to sign later. Two delegates never signed at all. As new delegates joined the Congress, they were also allowed to sign. A total of 56 delegates eventually signed.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	515
The first and most famous signature on the engrossed copy was that of John Hancock of Massachusetts, President of the Continental Congress. Two future presidents, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26), was the youngest signer, and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) was the oldest signer.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	328
"In January 1777, Congress decided the Declaration should be more widely distributed. Printer Mary Katherine Goddard was commissioned to print a version containing the text and names of the signatories. Today, these copies are known as the ""Goddard broadsides"". Nine copies are known to still exist."	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	298
In 1823, printer William J. Stone was commissioned by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams to create an engraving of the document essentially identical to the original. Stone's copy was made using a wet-ink transfer process, where the surface of the document was moistened, and some of the original ink transferred to the surface of a copper plate which was then etched so that copies could be run off the plate on a press. Because of poor conservation of the 1776 document through the 19th century, Stone's engraving, rather than the original which has largely faded, has become the basis of most modern reproductions.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	619
A handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence signed by the members of the Continental Congress is on display in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. It was the first of the three main Charters of Freedom, along with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	270
The text of the Declaration of Independence can be divided into five sections: the introduction, the preamble, the indictment of George III, the denunciation of the British people, and the conclusion.

When, in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the Causes which impel them to the Separation.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	408
That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	440
Prudence indeed, will dictate, that Governments long established, should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	575
This section is presented as a syllogism, with one proposition leading to another proposition. From the first proposition (that all men are created equal), a chain of logic is produced that leads to the right and responsibility of revolution when a government becomes destructive of the people's rights.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	303
Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The History of the Present King of Great-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let the Facts be submitted to a candid World.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	401
He has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and Convulsions within.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	317
He has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	254
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule in these Colonies:	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	265
He is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	284
He has excited domestic Insurrections among us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	242
In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	283
"In this section, the signers then list 27 grievances against the British Crown. The grievances are directed personally at the King (as in ""He has refused his Assent to Laws...""), although many of them refer to actions taken by the British Parliament or the Royal Governors. Many of the grievances are examples of violations of fundamental English law, such as ""imposing taxes on us without our Consent"", and ""depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury"". Many historians maintain that some of the grievances are exaggerated propaganda (such as the ""Swarms of Officers"" in truth referring to about fifty men ordered to prevent smuggling)."	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	655
Nor have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. We have warned them from Time to Time of Attempts by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	715
We, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of the divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	950
In this section, the signers assert that (since conditions exist under which people must change their government, and the British have produced such conditions) the colonies must necessarily throw off political ties with the British Crown and become independent states. The conclusion contains, at its core, the Lee Resolution that had been passed on July 2. The signatures have been listed here labeled with the states each group of delegates came from; this is not seen in the original Declaration.	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	500
"Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down. While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage. So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label."	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	430
"Jefferson's original draft included a denunciation of the slave trade (""He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.""), which was later edited out by Congress, as was a criticism of the British people and parliament. According to Jefferson:"	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	482
"""The pusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason, those passages which conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out, lest they should give them offense."""	5197	United_States_Declaration_of_Independence	63	248
Paul of Tarsus, also known as Saint Paul the Apostle, (AD 9–67) was a jewish-Roman, writer and rabbi. He wrote the Pauline Epistles in the New Testament. It is believed that he wrote thirteen books of the Bible, all of which are letters to churches and Christians, encouraging them, helping them to understand Christian teaching and helping them to live Christian lives.	5227	Paul_the_Apostle	63	370
Paul's name was originally Saul. He was born in present-day Turkey, grew up learning both the Jewish law and the Greek ways of discussing things. When the Christian movement began, after the death of Jesus, he was strongly against it. He worked for the Roman Government and helped lead the arrests and killing of many Christians in Israel and the nearby area.	5227	Paul_the_Apostle	63	359
While he was on the road to Damascus in search of Christians there, he had a vision. In the vision Jesus Christ spoke to him, telling Saul that his persecution of Christians was a persecution of Jesus himself, and that it did not please God. Saul was blinded by the vision. A short time later he met Ananias, a disciple of Jesus, and his sight came back to him. (see Acts 22:12)	5227	Paul_the_Apostle	63	378
Saul was baptised as a Christian. He spent the next three years studying the Jewish scriptures again to find explanations for the Christian teachings. His viewpoint completely changed by his experiences. He changed his name to Paul and he dedicated his life to serving Jesus Christ. He used his earlier education to explain his new faith to other people, and discuss things with people who had other beliefs. He traveled around the Roman Empire, teaching others about Christianity, and wrote letters back and forth with the churches he helped to begin. The letters contain many important parts of Christian teaching.	5227	Paul_the_Apostle	63	616
There are 10 recognized subspecies of tiger. One became extinct in prehistoric times. The remaining subspecies all survived at least into the mid-20th century. The tiger has 6 living subspecies, and 3 extinct (†) subspecies. These three were made extinct sometime in the last two centuries.	1885	Tiger	63	290
Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is native to the Indian subcontinent. In 2010, it became endangered. They are the second largest tiger, after the Siberian tiger. There are less than 2,500 of these tigers. There are about 1,500–1,900 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 124–229 in Nepal and 67–81 in Bhutan.	1885	Tiger	63	305
Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris corbetti) is found in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southwestern China. This tiger is also known as the Corbett's tiger, named after Jim Corbett. Indochinese tigers are darker in color than the Bengal tiger, and have narrow stripes which usually break up into a row of spots. It has been listed as endangered.	1885	Tiger	63	362
"Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is the largest cat in the world. They are also known as the ""Amur Tiger"". They live in eastern Russia's birch forests. Some are found in China and North Korea. It is estimated that there are around 400 to 500 Siberian tigers left in the wild."	1885	Tiger	63	283
Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) is the smallest tiger subspecies. It is critically endangered. It is hunted for its fur and other body parts, and its habitat is being lost. It is estimated that there are only a few hundred Sumatran tigers left in the wild. The Sumatran tiger is found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. They live in low and highland areas, to mountainous jungles and peat swamp forests.	1885	Tiger	63	420
South-Chinese tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is the second smallest tiger. It is found on mountains, and in temperate, upland forests of southern China. There are now 20-30 of them left in the wild and 60 left in captivity. It is one of the world's 10 most endangered animals and the most endangered of the six surviving tiger subspecies. The South-Chinese tiger is also known as the Chinese, Amoy, or Xiamen tiger.	1885	Tiger	63	418
Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) was discovered in 2004. It was thought they were Indochinese tigers, but they now have their own subspecies. They have the same length and weight as the Indochinese tiger. They live in southern Malaysia. They are an endangered species.	1885	Tiger	63	276
Tigers can weigh up to 850 lbs and measure up to at least 11 ft. The animal is distinctive for its reddish-orange coat, black stripes, and snow white belly. No two tigers have the same pattern of stripes. These stripes act as camouflage when the tiger is hunting.	1885	Tiger	63	263
Sometimes there are tigers with different colors. There are white tigers that have white fur with black stripes. Some even have pure white fur. They have blue or green eyes. Most Bengal tigers have orange fur. The white coat only appears once in every 10,000 births.	1885	Tiger	63	266
Tiger populations are declining; people hunt them for their skin and destroy the habitats they live in. The Bengal tiger has the largest population with 3,500 left in the wild. The South-Chinese tiger has the smallest population with only 20 or 30 left in the wild and about 60 in captivity.	1885	Tiger	63	291
"Famous literary tigers include the one ""burning bright"" in William Blake's poem ""The Tyger""; Shere Khan in The Jungle Books by Rudyard Kipling, the four melting tigers in Little Black Sambo, Tigger in the Winnie the Pooh books by A. A. Milne, and Hobbes in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes."	1885	Tiger	63	291
"A bicycle, or bike, is a small, human powered land vehicle with a seat, two wheels, two pedals, and a metal chain connected to cogs on the pedals and rear wheel. A frame gives the bike strength, and all of the parts other than the frame are attached to the frame. The name comes from these two wheels - the prefix ""bi-"" meaning two, and the suffix ""-cycle"" meaning wheel. It is powered by a person riding on top, who pushes the pedals around with his or her feet."	919	Bicycle	63	463
Riding bicycles, which is also called cycling, is an important way to travel in several parts of the world. It is also a common recreation, a good form of low-impact exercise, and a popular sport. It is also the second most popular spectator sport in the world.	919	Bicycle	63	261
In the 1860s, French inventors added pedals to the front wheel. However, it took a lot of effort to turn the pedals. Later inventors made bikes out of metal only, and made the front wheel very big, giving higher speed. This design was called the penny-farthing bicycle. However, it was difficult to ride, since it could fall easily.	919	Bicycle	63	332
Several improvements were made in the 1880s and '90s. In 1885, the safety bicycle was invented. This had two wheels the same size so that the rider could sit at a lower height. It was called the safety bicycle because it much easier to ride than the penny-farthing. Instead of pedaling and steering with the front wheel, the safety bicycle used steering with the front wheel while the pedals turned the back wheel using a chain. Brakes operated by hand levers on some bikes also increased safety.	919	Bicycle	63	496
Soon, the freewheel was invented. This was a device inside the hub of the back wheel that allowed the wheel to spin even if the rider wasn't pedalling. However, this meant the rider could no longer stop the bike by backpedalling. As a result, a different type of brake was invented which could stop the bike if the pedals were turned backwards. Later inventions included better brakes, and gears, which made cycling over hills much easier. During this time the bicycle became very popular.	919	Bicycle	63	489
The difference between a woman's bicycle and other bicycles is the location of the top tube. When women began to ride bikes, they wore long skirts. The manufacturers of bicycles changed the location of the top tube to make it easier for women to sit down on them while wearing a skirt.	919	Bicycle	63	285
In the U.S. the federal government has set a limit of 750 Watts and a top electric-powered speed of 20MPH to have only the rules that apply to bicycles and no extra restrictions such as operator license, vehicle license, registration or insurance requirements.	919	Bicycle	63	260
"A road bicycle usually has smaller tires, less than 1"" thick, with a frame that is much lighter than a mountain bicycle. Road bikes are a great option for training longer distances and changing out the pedals for clip in shoes are the best way to go. There are variations, as some road bicycles have regular tires. A road bike can go very fast and is a good choice when participating in a bike race."	919	Bicycle	63	399
An adjective is a kind of word (a part of speech) that modifies (describes) a noun. Nouns are words that name a place, a person, a thing, or an idea. An adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it (accompanies).	5623	Adjective	63	248
"Sometimes there are different forms of the same adjective. If one joke makes a person laugh more than another joke, then that joke is funnier. This is called the comparative form of the adjective. The day that is colder than any other is the coldest day. This is the superlative form of ""cold"". Some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them. For instance, one car may be cheaper than another, but the second car may be more reliable. (We use ""more reliable"", instead of ""reliabler"".) Reliable means worthy of trust."	5623	Adjective	63	536
"For short adjectives ending in a consonant like ""cold,"" ""black,"" or ""fast,"" one adds the suffix er to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: ""The North Pole is colder than Florida."" The greatest possible comparison is made by adding the suffix est. Example: ""The North Pole is the coldest place on the Earth."" For long adjectives like intelligent, conscientious, comprehensive, one uses the word more to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: ""Children are more intelligent than adults."" To make the greatest possible comparison one uses the word most. Example: ""She is the most conscientious person I have ever known."""	5623	Adjective	63	639
"In the English language, it is possible for a noun to modify (describe) another noun. Example: take the noun ""angel"" and the noun ""face."" Put them together and the result is ""angel face."" The first noun is acting like an adjective, because it is giving us information about the second noun."	5623	Adjective	63	290
"Adjectives are words we use to describe the noun. Simple words like sparkling and fat are both adjectives commonly used in writing. One can make adverbs from some adjectives by adding the suffix ly. Example: take the adjective ""beautiful,"" the adverb is beautifully. One can do it the other way around: take an adverb like ""presumably,"" the adjective is ""presumable"" (assumable). ""Presumable innocence"" means the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty (which is not always practiced everywhere, however)."	5623	Adjective	63	519

Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players. It is played on a board with spaces. In the original version the spaces were named after streets. These streets are actual streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London. Like many board games, each player has his or her own game token to move on the board. If he/she passes the go space, he/she collects £200. There is also a pair of dice, and play money. A person wins by having the most money at the end of the game.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	562
"Monopoly was created by Elizabeth Magie based on the economic concept of land monopoly. Magie created the game in 1903, to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. She wanted it to be an educational tool to highlight the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. Her game, which she called ""The Landlord's Game"", was self-published, beginning in 1906. In the original rules, players could agree to share the land rents and everyone would win, which was not as exciting as the current rules, unfortunately. Later on, an inaccurate myth developed that Charles Darrow had created the game."	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	612
On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are the space where each player begins, called GO; Free Parking, JAIL, and Go to Jail. Along the sides of the board are properties and businesses for sale. There are 22 properties, 4 railway stations, the Electric Company and the Water Works. There are also spaces called Income Tax and Luxury Tax, and Community Chests and Chances.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	402
To prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are placed on the board. The Chance and Community Chest cards are cards that can help players earn money or lose money, by taking the player to a land that is owned by someone else who collects rent. Once the board is set up, each play picks a token (a playing piece). Some of the tokens include: a battleship, a thimble, a shoe, an iron, a top hat, a dog, a wheelbarrow, a horse & rider, and a cannon. (There are more token shapes. It depends on the game edition). Then the banker (it can be any player) hands out the money, each player gets the same amount to start of with:	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	668
The banker is in charge of the bank. The bank has the money, Title Deed cards, and the houses and hotels. The bank gives a player 2M every time (s)he passes go, collecting money when a player buys land, houses or hotels, handing out the Deed cards when the land is bought, and loaning money when a player mortgages their land. The bank also collects fines, loans and interest, and taxes.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	387
Whenever you land on a land that no one owns, you can buy it from the bank. If you do not want to buy it the Banker sells it at an auction. (Not everyone plays by the auction rule). All of the prices for the land are on the board. Once you own the land, players must pay a rent if they are waiting on your land.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	311
Jail- There are three ways to get into jail 1) you land on the space labeled “Go to Jail” 2). You pick a Chance or Community Chest card that says “Go to Jail” or 3) you roll doubles three times. And there are also three ways to get out of jail: 1) you get three turns to roll a double, if you do not roll a double in the three turns you must pay the fine 2) using a “Get out of Jail Free” card (can be found in Chance or Community Chest), 3) pay a fine of 500k.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	461
Once you own all of one color, you can start to build houses. Houses make the land more costly and every time you add a house the price goes up more. Once there are four houses on each land you can get a hotel (there can only be one hotel on any land).	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	252
If you are going to mortgage land to the back, you have to sell houses or hotels back first. You can find the price of the mortgage on the back of the deed card. If the land is mortgage rent cannot be collected. To unmortgage land, you have to pay the mortgage plus 10% interest. For example, if the mortgage were 1M, 10% would be 100k. So you would have to pay 1.1M.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	367
"Prior to the start of the game: if the players agree if you land on ""Go"" you collect twice the amount receiving 4M, instead of 2M. Also, free parking could start with an amount of players choice and added to when players pay ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance"" cards, and if you land on ""Free Parking"" you receive all the money in the middle of the board."	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	350
There are many editions of monopoly. I.U.Opoly features locations of the Indiana University campus. The game board has been altered to reflect many college campuses across America. Milton Bradley has also produced boards to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970sopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street property.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	422
PlayStation 2 has a Monopoly game that allows players all the fun without the math practice, since it is electonically calculated throughout the game. Options are available to play on a science fiction fantasy board, the traditional board, or a prehistoric board. The tokens represent the era chosen as well as the spaces on the board. For instance, in the scifi game one of the board spaces is a black hole.	6990	Monopoly_(game)	63	408
-Hands on Learning: Monopoly teaches children a variety of lessons while having fun. It may teach how to count and use money, addition and subtraction, strategies, and organizations, mathematics (not only counting but percentages, and patterns...), economic principles...

The Sri Lankan elephant (scientific name : Elephas maximus maximus) is an Asian elephant (scientific name : Elephas maximus). It is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant. The other two subspecies are the Indian elephant (scientific name : Elephas maximus indicus) and the Sumatran elephant (scientific name : Elephas maximus sumatranus). The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about 11 ft tall, and can weigh up to 12,000 lb. They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	523
These elephants are native to Sri Lanka, and once lived far and wide over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. There are many national parks where tourists may see the elephant. These elephants were always useful animals in Sri Lanka. They carried timber and participated in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. They were hugely numerous in the past and aggressively hunted. In modern times, they are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty. They are an endangered species because farming and other human developments are destroying their living areas.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	632
"Asian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Females may live to about 46 years; it is uncertain how long the males live. The Asian elephant's highest body point is on the head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. Their ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more ""nails"" than those of African elephants. They have five ""nails"" on each front foot, and four on each back foot."	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	508
"Only 7% of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. A tusk is a very long tooth that protrudes from the elephant's mouth. An elephant with huge tusks is called a ""tusker"". Females have short or no tusks. Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11 ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000 lb."	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	360
Like humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. Their memory is awesome. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past. Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	413
Like the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of 6 to 15 individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She may be the oldest and most experienced of the females in the group. Sometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	363
A mother and her babies have strong ties. Babies nurse for 2 to 5 years. All elephants in the group will help in different ways to raise and protect the babies. When males reach the age of sexual maturity, the matriarch and other members of the group will force them away. This is so these males will not mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will very likely be inferior babies. Some babies may even have birth defects. Young males often form bachelor groups. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the babies.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	611
Sri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, and sometimes they stand still and eat what they can reach around them. They eat shrubs, leaves, grasses, and vines. They sometimes raid farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants tend to feed mostly on different grasses.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	314
"Asian male elephants are called bulls. They reach sexual maturity around the age of 12. Between the age of 10 and 20, bulls enter an annual phase called ""musth"". This is a time when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female. Females are called cows. Once having successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in his mother's womb. He is born after an 18 to 22-month period. Twins are rare. At birth, the calf weighs about 220 lb. He nurses from his mother's breasts for up to three years. Once a cow gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Cows remain with their herd, but mature bulls are chased away."	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	743
Sri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	277
Sri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do. Elephant living areas in Sri Lanka are decreasing, and becoming fragmented because of forest clearing for human settlements and agriculture. This situation promotes conflicts between elephants and humans. These conflicts have led to the death of both humans and elephants, and the destruction of property. The problem is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. In 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and the terrorist group, the Tamil Tigers in the northeastern region, has also put elephants at great risk.	3546	Sri_Lankan_elephant	64	742
"Kick the Buddy is an app that allows players to beat a ragdoll figure to oblivion. Touted as a stress-relieving game, Kick the Buddy is a puppet-like figure that players, with their choice of weapon, inflict abuse upon until knocking out, exploding, or killing. The makers of the game say ""it's a way to relieve stress"". Players use weapons on a puppet-like figure until the cartoon faints, explodes or dies. The PEGI age restriction for Kick the Buddy is 12. (*) However, Kick The Buddy ended in April 2012 so it would be replaced and get a sequel known as Kick the Buddy: Second Kick."	14246	Kick_the_Buddy	64	586
This game started at 2011, but it wasn't so popular. Gold didn't exist, there were not many weapons, etc. On April 2012, so it may become more popular, it was removed, and later, it was remade as Second Kick. The game is currently being developed by Chill Fleet. In the loading screen for the current version, it is developed by Playgendary.	14246	Kick_the_Buddy	64	341

Buddy is a brown doll character. with some parts also being blue. The torso area has a large blue area, with a white star with a blue outline surrounding it, most likely to represent a shirt. This shirt area appears to be stitched together to the lower half of the torso, and each arm has a blue part stitched together to another part, supporting the idea that Buddy has a shirt. Each limb, including the head are attached together via ropes, but these ropes can seemingly be stretched infinitely. Buddy appears to have black, plastic beads for eyes, that appear to be glossy. Buddy has a mouth with human-like features, but there appears to be no lips whatsoever.	14246	Kick_the_Buddy	64	664
If a explosion happens inside a closed and broken fridgerator, with some cola bottles and buddy inside and shake it, once it explodes, inside the Fridgerator doors, some developer textures will appear, like some buddy sprites and possibly text.	14246	Kick_the_Buddy	64	244
The Bronze Age is the time period when people made tools from a metal called bronze. Bronze is a mixture of two other metals: nine parts copper to one part tin. Materials like wood and stone were also used for tools, but bronze was better for cutting and chopping, and was easy to shape. The Bronze Age was not at the same time everywhere, because different groups of people began to use bronze at different times. In Western Europe, the Bronze Age lasted from about 2000 BC until 800 BC. In the Middle East, it started about a thousand years earlier. For example, bronze was first used in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC. (*)	5686	Bronze_Age	64	621
Archaeologists think that people became more organised in the Bronze Age, because the making of metal tools was difficult and needed certain skills. The people who had these new skills would have been important. The new metal tools were bought, sold, or traded across larger distances.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	285
Later, when iron tools spread, the Bronze Age ended and the Iron Age started. A reason for iron replacing bronze is that tin ore, a rock in which tin may found, is much more rare than iron ore. Copper tools were not useful because they were too soft.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	250
Farming allows more people in an area than can be supported by hunting and gathering. Crops can be stored for off-season use, or to sell or barter. Farmers could feed people to do other things than agriculture. This was a crucial factor in the rise of full-time armies.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	269
Sumerian agriculture allowed them to win battles and land. This made them early empire builders. Not long after, the Egyptians, farming in the fertile Nile valley, increased their population. There were now enough warriors for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	298
In Sumer, barley was the primary crop; wheat, flax, dates, apples, plums, and grapes were grown as well. Mesopotamian agriculture was both supported and limited by flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Floods came in late spring or early summer from snow melting from the Anatolian mountains.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	299
Sheep and goats were domesticated, kept mainly for meat, milk, butter and cheese. Ur, a large town that covered about 50 acres (20 hectares), kept 10,000 animals; 3,000 were slaughtered every year. The city's population of 6,000 included a labour force of 2,500, cultivated 3,000 acres (12 km²) of land. The labour force included storehouse recorders, work foremen, overseers, and harvest supervisors as well as labourers.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	422
The land was plowed by teams of oxen pulling light unwheeled plows and grain was harvested with sickle. Wagons had solid wheels covered by leather tires kept in position by copper nails and were drawn by oxen. As many as four animals could pull a wagon at one time. The horse was domesticated in Ukraine around 4000 BC, and was in use by the Sumerians around 2000 BC.	5686	Bronze_Age	64	367
"The scientific name is how species of any living organism are named by biologists. Is follows the binomial nomenclature, that is to say the name of a species is made of two parts: one indicating the genus and one indicating the species. Binomial nomenclature means ""two-part name"" or ""system of two-part names""."	5318	Scientific_name	64	311
The person who popularized this system for use was Swedish botanist and physician Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) (*) who tried to name all things in the natural world and gave every species (animal, vegetable or mineral) that he knew a two-part name. This kind of naming had been used before Linnaeus, but before Linnaeus, almost nobody used binomial nomenclature. After Linnaeus, about everybody did.	5318	Scientific_name	64	399
The value of the binomial nomenclature comes from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names in the system. The system replaced the use of Latin descriptive names, which were not handy as they were long (and growing all the time).	5318	Scientific_name	64	262
"An important reason for the stability of names is that they need not be descriptive. For example, Simmondsia chinensis has the component chinensis which means ""from China""; this was used in error, as the species is from California. Nevertheless, this name is used worldwide and is not to be 'corrected'. In today's system of naming, a name is just a label, and remains stable even if it is misdescriptive. Of course, ideally names should be descriptive; this makes it easier to remember them: Populus alba has leaves which are white underneath (alba means ""white"")."	5318	Scientific_name	64	565
The Amazon River (also named Rio Amazonas in Portuguese and Spanish) is a river that flows in South America.The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America. It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in Brazil.	856	Amazon_River	65	295
This river is the biggest by the amount of water it carries. It moves more water than the next eight rivers by amount put together. Amazon has the largest drainage basin in the world. It accounts for about one-fifth of the world's total river flow. During the wet season parts of the Amazon exceed 120 miles(190 km) in width. Because of its size, it is sometimes called The River Sea.	856	Amazon_River	65	384
It is one of the longest rivers in the world. There are different studies, that tried to measure its length. It is therefore difficult to say which of these rivers is really the Amazon. Also note that during the rainy season, the length of the river changes. Several studies from Brazil, Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world, longer than the Nile. The Nile has a length of 6,571 km. The Amazon may have a length of 6,218 kilometers. The Spanish daily newspaper El País gives its length at 6.850 kilometers. In 2007, scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of 6,800 km.	856	Amazon_River	65	600
A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of 6,448 km. This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac. Until the 1970s, it was thought that the Marañón River was the source of the Amazon. In 2001, an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was, in fact, the source of the Amazon.	856	Amazon_River	65	292
The estuary of the Amazon is about 205 miles (330km) wide. The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca. Generally, the outlet of the Para River is included. It is 37 miles (60km) wide and forms the estuary of the Tocantins. The estuary also includes the island of Marajó, which lies in the mouth of the Amazon. This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames in England.	856	Amazon_River	65	457
The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river. This wave goes along the coast for about 99 miles (160 km). The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called tidal bore. Locally it is known as pororoca. The pororoca occurs where the water is less than 23ft (7m) deep. It starts with a loud noise and advances at a speed of 9–16 mph (15-25 km/h). The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta. The ocean rapidly carries away a large amount of silt brought by the Amazon. This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline. It also has a very large tide, that can reach 20ft (6m). The place has become popular for river surfing.	856	Amazon_River	65	690
No bridges have been built over the Amazon. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge. For most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through tropical rainforest, there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry, there is no need to build a bridge.	856	Amazon_River	65	379
The river is the main route of traffic in the region. Big ocean ships can get up the river until Manaus, which is almost 1500 kilometers from its mouth. Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m (26 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru, 2,300 miles (3,700 km) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (486 mi) higher as far as Actual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichia's, just above Actual Point.	856	Amazon_River	65	458
The Portuguese language uses the Latin alphabet now with the letters k, w, and y. They use six different diacritics to change the sounds that the letters make in words. Here are the different letters that are changed by diacritics: á, â, ã, à, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, .	6996	Portuguese_language	66	269
Portuguese is spoken all over the world. Most people in Portugal and Brazil speak Portuguese as their first language. It is the official language of Portugal, Brazil, East Timor, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea. A few hundred years ago Portugal discovered, colonized and laid claim to many regions around the world.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	374
Portuguese colonization was distinct from other colonizing nations due to the small size of the nation (territory/population). The colonization process was a direct result of nautical exploration for commerce and trade routes and the goal to establish claims (see Padrão), more than a pressure to expand population. A significative part of the population necessary to maintain the new territorial claims were in fact not even of Portuguese origin, Galegos (from Galicia - Spain) and Flemengos (Flemish people) were, especially in the earlier stages of expansion, of great importance to the crown. For similar reasons there was also a great level of interbreeding with locals and population movement from colony to colony, more than any other European nation.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	758
As can be seen above the Portuguese Empire (Império Ultramarino, overseas empire) included Brazil, countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. It was the longest-lived modern European colonial empire and the first global empire in history. Portuguese settlers (and settlers from other nations under license from Portugal) went to the new colonies, established the government and business, ruling over any existing indigenous populations. The new colonies continued to speak Portuguese and indigenous were required to learn the language in order to interact with the state representatives. Portuguese was often established as a common language on ethnically distinct regions that have several local dialects (i.e.: Angola and Guinea-Bissau) and this practice continues after their independence or as a way to preserve Historico-cultural distinction like in East Timor. Although Portuguese is not the official language in Goa and Macao it is still spoken by minorities on those regions and the language also had a deep influence in nations that it entered in contact, for instance Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach Japan and one of the many legacies was the adoption of some Portuguese language into Japanese.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	1214
Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) formed by Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea, part of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) an the intergovernmental organization for friendship among lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	353
There are also large communities of Portuguese speaking people in other parts of the world such as the United States, Andorra, France, Luxembourg, Jersey, Venezuela, and South Africa. Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South Africa.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	305
Portuguese is one of the romance languages, which means it is one of many descendants of Latin (Ibero-Roman group). All of these languages split from Latin long ago. During the Middle Ages the Latin in North Portugal and Galicia (northwestern Spain) slowly became a language called Galician-Portuguese. Galician-Portuguese was a mix of Latin and some of the local pré-Roman languages: Celt, Lusitanian. It also contains influences from the invaders of the Roman Empire: Vandals, Visigoths and later Arabic invaders from northern Africa (the Moors), even French due to cultural relations and English due to economical relations have enriched the language. The discoveries age enriched Portuguese language by giving lots of words from Africa, Asia and America.	6996	Portuguese_language	66	758
The Ottoman Empire lasted from 1299 to 1923. It was centered in Turkey and controlled the eastern and southern lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The empire was created by Ottoman Turks and was most powerful from around 1400 to 1600, when it controlled trade and politics in southeastern Europe, southwest Asia, and northern Africa. Suleiman the Magnificent was one of the most powerful rulers.	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	395
"The empire was a collection of conquered countries. The Sultan sent governors to rule these countries or provinces, with titles such as Pasha or Bey. The most famous in the early 19th century was Muhammad Ali Pasha. In later years, the Ottoman Empire began to weaken. In the latter part of the 19th century became known as ""the sick man of Europe""."	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	348
In the early years of the empire, shahzadahs, who were the sons of the Sultan, used to be sent to Sanjaks (different parts of the empire) to have experience and to later govern. This was because they were candidates for the Sultanate and Caliphate.	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	248
After Ahmed this system changed. In the new system the Sultan would keep all his male relatives locked in a small apartment called a kafes where they would never be able to see the outside world, and would therefore be unable to take power from him. Often, a new Sultan would simply have his male relatives killed, a simpler solution since it removed competition for the Sultanate and prevented rebel movements. However, the women in his harem often sought greater status and influence, and the Sultan's mother might become the most powerful political force in the Empire, because each mother in the harem would try to make her own son the next Sultan, since they knew he would probably be killed if he was not.	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	711
The Sultans quickly lost their ability to govern far-away territories well, and all the peoples living in the Empire were soon governing themselves under their own laws. By its end, the Ottoman Empire grew so worn out and corrupt that it was ready to collapse.	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	260
Many places were vassal states to the empire rather than being directly ruled. These included Transylvania, Moldavia, Wallachia, (Romania), Caucasus (Georgia, Dagestan, and Chechnya. Their rulers received a degree of independence and autonomy from the Ottoman Empire. The price for this autonomy was more money (tax or tribute) paid to the Sultan.	5684	Ottoman_Empire	66	347
"The history of Turin started in the 2nd century Before Christ, when on the banks of the river Po, the first Celtic tribe settled, looking for arable plains. These tribes were called Taurisc: hence the word ""Torino"" and the nickname ""city of the tauri (latin for bulls)""."	5389	Turin	66	270
It became a Roman city in 28 B.C. under the name of Augusta Taurinorum. In those times, it was a military centre surrounded by walls and with a square plant. After the fall of the Roman empire, it passed under the control of the Ostrogoths, the Lombards and the Franks. This is one of the darkest historical periods of the city.	5389	Turin	66	328
In 19th century, Turin was the centre of the Italian Risorgimento with Vittorio Emmanuele II, King of the Savoy dynasty, Camillo Benso Count of Cavour, Giuseppe Garibaldi, men who managed to unify Italy. Thus, in 1861, Turin became the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy (which lasted until 1865).	5389	Turin	66	300
Fiat (which means Turin Italian Car Factory): it is the main Italian car manufacturing business. It has many known brands in its group (Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati, Jeep, Alfa-Romeo and more recently Chrysler). His base was original because its roof is a track car.	5389	Turin	66	263
Justinian I (born 11 May 483 and died 13 November 565) was a Byzantine emperor who reigned from 527 to 565. He was one of the most important rulers of the late antiquity. He is above all known for originating a group of very important laws, the Code of Justinian, which regulated life in the Byzantine Empire for centuries, and strongly influenced Europe in Medieval times.	5231	Justinian_I	66	373
Justinian also increased the territories of his Empire during his reign, for he tried to reconstruct the Roman Empire as it was in the second century. On the religious front, he has also played a great role, trying to unify the Christian beliefs but also to impose his views on the Pope.	5231	Justinian_I	66	287
Justinian (Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Justinianus in Latin) was born in Illyria on 11 May 483, in the city of Tauresium. He came from a fairly modest family of Roman culture. He was the nephew of a soldier, Justin, who had so much military success that he became an emperor in 518, under the name Justin I.	5231	Justinian_I	66	304
Justin I took Justinian under his wing to involve him in his business. Justinian was then named patrician, and then consul. When his uncle died, in 527, Justinian became Emperor under the name Justinian I. In 523, Justinian married an actress, Theodora, who then became Empress. She had a large amount of influence over him.	5231	Justinian_I	66	324
Justinian has great qualities to be emperor: he has a sense of the state, it is capable of much work and lives fairly simply. He also had much artistic and religious knowledge. Justinian was also able to take men of quality as advisors to, which would allow him to have a very important reign.	5231	Justinian_I	66	293
Justinian's reign marked the transition of the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire east of the Mediterranean Sea. Justinian dreamed of recovering the greatness of the Roman Empire, but this had disappeared beginning in 476, in part because of the Germanic invasions. He will therefore, while expanding his empire, focusing on its eastern side, and make it stand on its own.	5231	Justinian_I	66	374
He attacked the Vandal Kingdom, in North Africa, and defeated it in September 533. In liberating the Mediterranean from Vandal ships, this allowed him to conquer Corsica, Sicily, and Sardinia. This conquest was often threatened by other kings, notably the Ostrogothic kings, but Justinian managed to maintain control of Italy throughout his reign. Taking advantage of the quarrels between the Visigoth leaders in Spain, he secured Baetica (modern-day Andalusia).	5231	Justinian_I	66	462
Justinian was the last emperor to try to reunite the two parts of the former Roman Empire. But the wars had been very costly. Therefore, his successors, while not giving up the title of Roman Emperor will not seek any more to take military control of the whole Empire, which will gradually lose territories. Progressively, the empire shrunk back down to the Greek world.	5231	Justinian_I	66	370
The Byzantine Empire was already wealthy when Justinian became Emperor. He was thus able to begin reforming the laws. He asked his advisors to bring order to the laws, in particular the edicts that dated from the reigns of Emperors Hadrian and Diocletian. This reorganizations produced a set of laws, at the time called Corpus Juris Civilis (in Latin), which is known today as the Code of Justinian. This code was written in 529. It was written in Latin, the official language of the empire.	5231	Justinian_I	66	491
He also published a modernization of ancient Roman jurisprudence, called the Digest in 533, and a manual for teaching law, called the Institutes (at 533). The new laws that Justinian wanted were written in Greek, and are known as the Novels. They date from after 534.	5231	Justinian_I	66	267
In addition to this reorganization of the laws, Justinian wanted to change and modernize the way the empire functioned. He groups together some provinces, change the ways the Empire function, and often let the provinces be governed by the military to maintain order. His government was very authoritarian.	5231	Justinian_I	66	305
Justinian considered himself to be chosen by God. He wants to rule the Church in exchange for military protection it gives against the heresies. He was a true Christian. For him, Christianity was a state religion, meaning that all of the empire's inhabitants had to be Christian, and that he had the right to decide what was good for the Church.	5231	Justinian_I	66	345
Justinian's empire was very wealthy, due to the destruction of the Vandal Kingdom, which decreased piracy in the Mediterranean Sea, and thanks to Justinian's conquests. Byzantine merchants were able to conduct trade throughout the Mediterranean world.	5231	Justinian_I	66	251
All of this wealth permitted the development of a significant cultural life. Justinian and his wife Theodora sought to recover the greatness of Ancient Rome. Hymns (a type of religious poem) were composed to glorify the Emperor and Christianity. Artists were invited to enrich and embellish Byzantium and other cities in the Empire.	5231	Justinian_I	66	332
"Justinian was first great builder. He ordered the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (Byzantium's other name) (dedicated to divine Wisdom, or ""Sophia"" in Greek) with the aid of 2 architects, 100 master builders, and 10,000 workmen. It was built between 532 and 537 by the architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus. The first cupola having collapsed in 558, a second was rebuilt in 562."	5231	Justinian_I	66	414
The London Eye is a large metal Ferris wheel. It is also known as the Millennium Wheel and is one of the largest observation wheels in the world. Since mid-January 2015 it has been known in branding as the Coca-Cola London Eye, after an agreement signed in September 2014.	6799	London_Eye	66	272
The Eye was opened in 2000. It is 135 metres high. At the time it was built, in 1999, it was the tallest giant wheel in the world, and at present it is Europe's tallest Ferris wheel. (*) It offered the highest public viewing point in London. (*) The 245-meter observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard is now the highest public view of London.	6799	London_Eye	66	349
The bees gather nectar from flowers. Bees also collect flower pollen. In the hive, bees turn the nectar to honey, and feed the larvae with the pollen. Honey is stocked and pollen may also be kept in the hive to feed the larvae in time of bad weather.	975	Honey_bee	67	250
The honey bee is one of the most common domesticated insects (with the silkworm). It is bred for its honey and its wax. Farmers sometimes keep several hives near orchards. The bees help pollinate the blossoms of the fruit trees. Honey bee is a best example show in nature for social behavior.	975	Honey_bee	67	292
Bees are flying insects with two pairs of transparent wings. Honey bees are the most well-known kind of bee. They live in colonies and make honey. Honey bees have a hairy striped body. Each pair of a honey bee's legs is designed for certain tasks like cleaning antennae, carrying pollen, or picking wax made by their body. The mouth is suited for chewing solid food like pollen and for lapping up liquids like nectar.	975	Honey_bee	67	417
Bees make their own nests using wax, propolis, plant parts, mud etc. The wild nests are often built in holes bored into wood, in underground tunnels, or in cracks and crevices in buildings. Some Asian bees can make their hives in the open on trees and shrubs.	975	Honey_bee	67	259
"In the three jobs of the honey bee, there are queen, worker and drone bees. These different types of bees are called ""castes."" The main food differs for each caste. The queen and the growing larva are fed with a liquid called royal jelly that is secreted by the worker bees. As a honey bee grows, its food changes from royal jelly to pollen and nectar. The adult workers feed mostly on nectar and honey. Honey bees convert nectar into honey and store it for times like winter when nectar and pollen are not available."	975	Honey_bee	67	517
Female honey bees have stingers. Worker bees sting to defend the colony when they feel threatened. A bee's stinger is in the last segment of its abdomen. The bee dies after it stings. Though they have a sting, most bees don't use it. The stinger is connected to a venom gland. Worker bees have tiny barbs in the stinger like a harpoon. Because of these barbs, the stinger is ripped from the bee while stinging and the bee dies due to the injury. The stinger is left in the body of the victim. If the stinger is not removed, venom continues to be pumped into the wound by pulsing venom glands.	975	Honey_bee	67	592
Bee stings are painful, and can lead to health problems if they are not treated correctly. Quick removal of the stinger will reduce the pain and swelling. For some people, the sting can cause allergic reactions. Bee stings can be dangerous, depending on these allergic reactions, if there are too many stings and if not treated immediately.	975	Honey_bee	67	340
Some subspecies, like the africanized bee, are more irritable. These bees are present in North and South America. It is a good idea not to go near a bee colony unless one is has a good knowledge of handling bees. Often it is difficult to tell the difference africanized bees and domesticated bees in the wild.	975	Honey_bee	67	309
The eggs hatch by the third day after laying or within a few days. When the eggs hatch, they become larvae and can develop into an either a queen or worker. During the larval stage growth rate is high and hence larvae are hungry and eat a lot. Adult bees take care of the larvae by feeding them and keeping them warm. The larval stage lasts for a week or two, after which larvae enter the dormant pupal stage. The pupal stage lasts for anywhere from a week to a couple of weeks. Larvae and Pupae are housed in special cells prepared by adult bees made of wax. Larvae do not forage on their own and require parental care to survive.	975	Honey_bee	67	631
Each honey bee colony has different castes of bees that look different from each other. Each honey bee colony has a queen. The queen is the only female that can lay fertilized eggs. Despite her name, the queen doesn't rule the colony, the colony has no true leader. Every bee in the hive knows what it has to do. Queens are a bit larger in size compared to other castes in the colony. There are also a few drones in the honey bee colony which are male bees which have only reproductive function. Drones mate with newly emerged queens of other colonies. After mating the drones die.	975	Honey_bee	67	581
The majority of bees in a honey bee colony are female worker bees. Usually, they cannot lay eggs unless the queen dies. Every bee has a distinct role, depending on her age and on the needs of the season. Some bees stay in the hive, they feed the queen, drones and the young larvae. They also build, maintain and defend the hive. Other bees venture outside the hive to search for food. They forage for nectar, and make nectar into honey. Honey bees also collect and store pollen in special cells for reserve food. The pollen appears as two colored balls on a bee's back legs.	975	Honey_bee	67	574
A major activity of worker bees in a honeybee colony is preparation of honey. The worker bees lap up nectar (which is water like in consistency) from flowers and other plant parts. They store the nectar in their stomach until they return to their hive. In the bee's stomach water is removed from the nectar to concentrate and thicken the nectar. Some digestive juices also mix with the nectar. When the bee returns to the hive, the concentrated nectar is regurgitated into special honey storing cells. The nectar becomes thicker by evaporation. When needed, the worker bees beat their wings to create an air flow in the hive. This is called fanning. When nectar in the cells reaches the required thickness it is called honey and the cells are sealed with wax by the bees.	975	Honey_bee	67	771
Bees, like most insects, communicate using chemical signals called pheromones. In addition to this, honey bees also communicate by movement inside the hive. This is called bee dance. The communication by bee dance is symbolic and is thought to convey the direction and distance of a food source from the hive.	975	Honey_bee	67	309
Beekeeping is raising and caring bee-hives to produce honey and other products. Honey may be taken from honey bee colonies in the wild in some country and more typically from colonies that are reared in apiaries (bee farms). Honey is the major apiary product. In addition to it, a beekeeper may harvest and sell pollen, bee's wax, propolis and royal jelly.	975	Honey_bee	67	356
There are other families of bees, though. These other types of bees are different from honey bees in look, feeding, and nesting habits. Many are solitary. There are bumble bees, mining bees, leaf cutter bees, mason bees, digger bees, carpenter bees and many others. These other types of bees are common but aren't as familiar as honey bees. Some species of leaf cutter bees and wood borer bees are household or garden pests that eat plant parts like leaves and flowers, or bore into wooden articles in the house hold. A few bee species that do not have stingers bite using the mandibles. Mandibles are mouth parts of the insect that are using for cutting and chewing. The scientific name for all bees is Apoidea.	975	Honey_bee	67	712
"Bees should not be confused with wasps, their relatives. Wasps usually have a yellow and black striped body while bees more often have a grey and brownish striped body. Bees look more ""hairy"". Bees, wasps, hornets and ants belong to a common insect order Hymenoptera. All these insects have transparent wings and share a similar anatomy."	975	Honey_bee	67	337
The North Sea is a sea in northern Europe. It is part of the Atlantic ocean. The North Sea is between Norway and Denmark in the east, Scotland and England in the west, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in the south. About 80 million people live near the North Sea, at most 150 km away from the coast. Together with the English Channel in the south, the southern North Sea is the busiest body of water in the world.	499	North_Sea	69	425
The border between the North Sea and the Skagerrak is at an imagined line between Lindesnes in Norway, and Hanstholm in Denmark. In the North, the North sea is open towards the Atlantic. The border between the two is an imagined line from Northern Scotland, to the Shetlands, and then to Ålesund in Norway. According to the Oslo-Paris Treaty of 1962 it is a bit more to the west and the north though. The treaty puts it at 5° East longitude, and 62° North latitude. That is at the parallel of the Geirangerfjord in Norway.	499	North_Sea	69	522
Rivers that drain into the North Sea include: from the United Kingdom, the Tay (at Dundee), the Forth (at Edinburgh), the Tyne (Tynemouth, South Shields), the Wear (at Sunderland), the Thames, and the Humber (at Hull); from Germany : the Ems,	499	North_Sea	69	242
Its name comes from its relationship to the land of the Frisians. They live directly to the south of the North Sea, and to the west of the East Sea (Oostzee, the Baltic Sea), the former South Sea (Zuiderzee, today's IJsselmeer) and the today reclaimed Middle Sea (Middelzee).	499	North_Sea	69	275
In the south it is very shallow, only 25 to 35 meters and there are many sand banks. It is composed of the Southern Bight, before the coast of Belgium and the Netherlands and the German Bight before the coastline of Germany. The Dogger Bank is the limit between the southern and central parts. The Waddenzee runs all the way from Den Helder in the Netherlands to Esbjerg in Denmark.In the Dover Strait the water is about 30 meters deep.	499	North_Sea	69	436
the central North Sea: the most shallow part of it is a sand bank called Dogger Bank with a depth between 13 and 20 metres only. The Dogger Bank covers an area about half the size of the Netherlands. The area is very famous for fishing. With some storms there are even waves breaking there.	499	North_Sea	69	290
the northern North Sea. In the north in the bathyal zone north of the Shetlands, this depth increases to between 100 and 200 metres. The Norwegian Trench, near the Skagerrak has an average depth of around 250 to 300 metres; at the entrance to the Skagerrak, the depth increases up to 725 meters for the glacial erosion on the quaternary era. Along the trench is the Norwegian Current, which brings most of the waters of the NorthSea into the Atlantic ocean. Also, most of the waters of the Baltic Sea flow northwards here.	499	North_Sea	69	522
About 200 km east of the Scottish city of Dundee generally, the water is about 90 meters depth there . But there are many trenches, named the Devil's hole . The trenches very often are only a few kilometers in length. In these trenches, the depth increases to up to 230 meters.	499	North_Sea	69	277
In the 1960s geologists found large areas of oil and natural gas under the North Sea. Most of the oil fields are owned by the United Kingdom and Norway but some belong to Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Drilling began in the 1960s and led to an argument between England and Scotland about how the revenue (money) from the oil should be spent.	499	North_Sea	69	348
During the 17th and 18th century, Protestants from the United Kingdom settled on the eastern coasts of the continent. In 1773, the British colonies wanted to become independent, but the British crown refused to lose their colonies and a war began between the American and English army. After 8 years of war, called the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain was defeated with the help of the French, and the Americans became independent. They called their country United States of America.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	492
After their independence, the USA expanded, and began exploring the western parts of North America, where they found gold. The Indians who lived there, were fought and sometimes massacred by white Americans. The USA also needed to produce crops. To produce these crops, they began abducting Africans from the western coasts of Africa, as slaves. Slaves were badly treated and had to work all day. Slavery was only abolished fully in the country, in 1865, as a result of the Civil War.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	484
In 1914, First World War began in Europe. The USA sent its army in Europe in 1917. After the war, the USA became richer, and industrialised itself by selling and exporting objects like cars. In World War II, the USA, allied with France and the United Kingdom, bombed the German army. The 6th June 1944, thousands of American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy. Bit by bit the Germans were defeated, and in 1945 war was won by the Americans, but millions of people had died during the war. At the end of the war, the United States was becoming the richest country in the World. Then, the United States made war against Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, thousands of Vietnamese were killed and 10,000 hectares of plantations were destroyed.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	746
"In the US, there was still racism. Black and white people were segregated (separated) in public areas such as buses. An American pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr. fought against racism. In 1963, a civil rights march was organised at Washington. This is where Martin Luther King made his most famous speech ""I have a dream"". But Martin Luther King was assassinated by James Earl Ray while he was standing on his balcony."	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	417
30,000 years ago, the sea was lower, connecting Siberia to Alaska. Tribes followed herds from Asia to America, passing by a stretch of land, called Beringia. They settled in America. Some went to polar areas, becoming Inuit (Eskimos), while others searched more land in the South. They became the first Indians (Christopher Columbus, upon discovering America, thought that he had reached India, and called the inhabitants Indians. Today, they may be called Indians or Indigenous Americans; in the USA, they are called Native Americans or First Nations; in Canada they are named Aboriginals.), and some settled in present-day USA.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	629
10,000 years ago, human populations exterminated all mammoths and horses from the country. Buffaloes were also hunted. Indians would only start to ride horses after these were reintroduced to America by Europeans; in ancient times, travel on land was done by walking.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	267
In 700 AD, Indians near the Mississippi began to build large constructions. One of their towns, Cahokia, had over a hundred mounds. (*) The city had a large temple, and a house for the chief and his servants. The town was abandoned around 1500.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	244
The Pueblo people wove their clothes, which were made from brightly dyed cotton. They carved statues from polished stone. Jugs with bold patterns were made by potters. When Pueblo chiefs were buried, pots with painted spirits were buried with them, and pierced to release the spirits.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	284
The Spanish focused their efforts in southern and Central America. After destroying the Aztec civilization, Hernán Cortés established colonies in present-day Mexico. They then headed north and created New Mexico and California, where they encountered various Indian nations.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	274
"The French, under the reign of Louis XIV, arrived in the Gulf of Mexico, and conquered southeastern North America. This territory was called Louisiana, in French ""Louisiane"", after the name of their king. In 1534, Jacques Cartier discovered Canada."	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	248
In 1620, a group of English Protestants, eager to worship God in their own way, boarded a ship called the Mayflower. They became known as the Pilgrims, or the Pilgrim Fathers. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean for three months, they landed in present-day Massachusetts, where they founded the colony of Plymouth. (*)	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	322
Their first winter was extremely harsh, but the local Indians helped them, and half of the settlers survived. After their first harvest, in November, the Pilgrims organised a meal – including some turkey – to thank the Indians for their help. This is why, on every November, Americans eat turkey, and remember the event, in a day called Thanksgiving.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	350
In the 1760s, the United States had already thirteen colonies, but was still controlled by England. As the taxes for the goods coming from England were increasing, the people of the colonies rebelled. In 1773, in the port of Boston, some people assaulted a trade ship transporting tea boxes, which they threw overboard, as a sign of their refusal to pay taxes. The equivalent of 800,000 pounds of tea sank in the sea. This episode was known as the Boston Tea Party.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	465
"The 4th July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from the British crown. The Declaration of Independence, mostly written by Thomas Jefferson, was adopted that day, and the colonies became an independent country, called ""the United States of America""."	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	270
The United Kingdom, who didn't want to lose their colonies, sent troops to America. This was the beginning of the War of Independence or American Revolutionary War, which opposed the new American army and the British. The first battles, like the Battle of Long island (1776), or Saratoga (1777), were won by England, whose soldiers were better armed and prepared. But in 1777, Louis XVI, king of France, sent French troops – led by Lafayette – to help the Americans in their fight for independence. Finally, in 1781, at the Battle of Yorktown, the English were defeated. The Thirteen Colonies officially became the United States, and a nation was born. A few years later in 1787, a new set of basic laws called the United States Constitution was written and adopted. In 1789, George Washington, leader of the Thirteen Colonies, became the first president of the United States.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	876
Before and after their independence, the United States had trade relations with Europe. To produce their crops, Americans needed workforce. At first, they began using Indians as slaves, but they almost all died. So the colonists later bought new slaves from the western coast of Africa.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	286
When they arrived in America, the survivors were sold as slaves, to the European landowners. They had to work all day to produce crops, and were whipped by their owners. When slaves tried to escape, they were found and punished, often violently.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	245
When they became an independent country, the United States covered a much smaller territory than today. Only the eastern coast was colonised, while Indians lived in the western part. The southern area of the present-day USA (from California to Texas) was occupied by Spain; and from Newfoundland (eastern Canada) to New Orleans, France had colonies.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	349
People from the United States settled in the northern parts of Mexico, in what has become present-day Texas. In 1835, they declared their independence from Mexico. But a war broke up between the Mexicans and the Americans. The Americans were led by Davy Crockett, and the Mexicans by Santa Anna. After ten years of war, including the battle of the Alamo, the Mexicans were defeated and Texas joined the USA.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	407
Some tribes, like the Lakotas (led by Sitting Bull), fought against the US army (led by General Custer) to defend their land. They won some battles, like the battle of Little Big Horn, but were defeated at the battle of Wounded Knee. The US army colonised all Indian territories, killed thousands of buffalo, and forced the Indians who had survived to speak English and live in camps guarded by US soldiers.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	407
The southern states decided to break away from the United States and form an independent country (a process called secession), but the American government rejected that demand. In 1861, a war broke out between the Northern States or Union states, and the Southern states or Confederate states, a war that lasted four years. The Union had more soldiers, called the Yankees, but the Confederate had better generals, and won many battles at first.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	444
In 1863, in Pennsylvania, the Union states won the battle of Gettysburg. After this victory, the Yankees advanced in the Southern states. They destroyed and burned cities, towns, villages on their passage. They also broke railway lines to stop the Confederates from bringing provisions, weapons and food to their soldiers.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	322
Also, Germany sent a secret coded message, called the Zimmerman Telegram (from the sender Arthur Zimmermann) to Mexico, which suggested that the two countries could attack the USA. But English spies found the message and announced the attack to the United States. Many people were angry against Germany and wanted to send American soldiers in Europe to fight against Germany.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	375
In the US, new objects like cars were developed. Modern engines were needed and factories were created. For his Model-T car, Henry Ford even developed a new way of organising factory work. The USA exported lots of industrial objects and became richer.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	251
In the 1920s, racism was still important in the US, and racist Americans called the Ku Klux Klan killed African-Americans illegally at night. They were dressed in white, and hooded for not being identified. The Ku-Klux-Klan would catch African-Americans, and then burn them on a cross.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	285
Between 1920 and 1933, it was made illegal to drink alcohol. This was called the Prohibition. But some people still drank illegally alcohol in bars called speakeasies. Votes were organised against it. Some gangsters like Al Capone became very rich by selling illegally alcohol.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	277
In 1939, World War II began in Europe. At the time, the USA president was Franklin Roosevelt. He allied with the president of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, and the French general Charles De Gaulle, and together they bombed Germany and France (occupied by the Nazis). Some of the bombs launched by the Americans accidentally killed French people, and some French thought that the Americans were their enemies.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	417
In 1944, Roosevelt had a meeting at Moscow with the president Churchill and the soviet dictator Stalin. They organised a gigantic attack against the German Nazis. Firstly, in the bay of Biscay, the American army made fake soldiers with fake tanks and fake guns.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	261
Then, the 6th June 1944, as the Germans sent its army on the bay of Biscay, 10,000 American soldiers arrived on the beaches of Normandy. This was called the D-Day. The German army quickly sent all its army in Normandy against the Americans. In passing, they destroyed two villages in southern France, killing everybody. A huge line of Nazi tanks went from southern France to Normandy. In Normandy, thousands of soldiers arrived by falling in parachute from aeroplanes or in boats. Slowly, the German army was pushed. The American Army took one month for gaining a few kilometres, but then they went faster and won against the Germans. Adolf Hitler, the German dictator, killed himself. In 1945, the Allies had won, but millions of people had died in the terrible war.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	767
At the end of the 2nd World War, the Americans had arrived in France and went up to Germany, while the Russians had passed by Poland. The two armies arrived almost at the same time at Berlin, and had together annihilated the Germans, but there was a problem: the USA was capitalist while the USSR was communist. The two huge and powerful countries began to be better than the other one.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	386
In 1945, after the Japanese occupation, Korea was divided in two parts: North Korea was for the USSR, and South Korea for the USA. Then, allied with China and Russia, North Korea (governed by Kim-Il Sung) decided to send 75,000 soldiers to attack South Korea in June 1950 (*) .	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	277

In 2016, Donald Trump, from the Republican party, became president, with Mike Pence as vice-president. They ran for re-election after a first term, but were defeated. Trump challenged the election results for miscounts in several states, but no flaws were proven anywhere.	5058	History_of_the_USA	69	272
The International System of Units is a system of measurement based on 7 base units: the metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), Kelvin (temperature), mole (quantity), and candela (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates SI derived units, which can be used to describe other quantities, such as volume, energy, pressure, and velocity.	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	415
In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units - length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the centimetre-gram-second system of units (CGS), which used the centimetre as the base unit for length, the gram as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the dyne as the base unit for force and the erg as the base unit for energy.	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	528
As scientists studied electricity and magnetism, they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the 20th century, many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing.	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	241
In 1954, the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, and candela. (*) The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971. (*)	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	287
SI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the United States, Liberia and Myanmar, where the older imperial units are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the British Empire, are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time.	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	332
"Very large or very small measurements can be written using prefixes. Prefixes are added to the beginning of the unit to make a new unit. For example, the prefix kilo- means ""1000"" times the original unit and the prefix milli- means ""0.001"" times the original unit. So one kilometre is 1000 metres and one milligram is a 1000th of a gram."	4509	International_System_of_Units	69	337
"The Ring of the Nibelung (German: Der Ring des Nibelungen) are four operas that tell the story of the hero Siegfried and a magic ring. The four operas are called a ""cycle"". These four operas are The Rhine Gold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried, and Twilight of the Gods."	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	261
Wagner intended the first opera in the cycle (The Rhine Gold) to be a prelude opera to the other three. It tells of events that precede the last three operas in the cycle. The last three operas tell the story of the hero Siegfried. They tell of his conception, youth, and death.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	278
The Rhine Gold. In the first opera of the cycle, the gold lying at the bottom of the Rhine River is stolen by a Nibelung dwarf. He forges a magic ring from this gold that will give its possessor power over the entire world. Its possessor will be troubled with great anxieties and will be killed when the ring is acquired by another. The next three operas in the cycle are the story of Siegfried, the hero of the Ring.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	417
The Valkyrie. In the second opera of the cycle, Siegmund and Sieglinde, fraternal twins and the last of the Walsung people, mate to produce an infant that will continue their race. This infant will eventually be called Siegfried. At the end of the opera, Brünnhilde, a Valkyrie, disobeys her father Wotan, the chief of the gods. He strips Brünnhilde of her immortality, makes her a mortal woman, and puts her to sleep on a rock surrounded by fire. Only a fearless man will be able to waken her.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	494
Siegfried. The third opera tells of the hero's youth. His father and mother, Siegmund and Sieglinde, are dead, and their child, Siegfried, has become the foster child of Mime, a Nibelung dwarf, who wants to acquire the magic ring for himself. In The Rhine Gold, the first opera of the cycle, the magic ring and the golden treasure of the race of the Nibelungs are given to a dragon called Fafner. Siegfried kills the dragon and takes the ring. He wakens Brünnhilde, and takes her for his mate.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	493
Twilight of the Gods. In the fourth and final opera in the cycle, Siegfried gives the magic ring to Brünnhilde when he leaves her for heroic adventures. In the court of the Gibichungs, he is given a potion of forgetfulness. He forgets Brünnhilde. Gibichung ruler Gunther and Siegfried seize her as Gunther's bride.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	314
Brünnhilde accuses Siegfried of faithlessness and treachery. Gunther and his sinister friend Hagen murder Siegfried. Brünnhilde orders his funeral pyre be made ready, then rides into the flames on her horse, Grane. The Rhine overflows, washing everything away. Valhalla burns in the heavens.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	291
The Ring of the Nibelung was first performed in its entirety at the Bayreuther Festspielhaus in Germany in 1876. It was a huge success. Today, opera companies perform the operas as stand-alones within a larger repertory of operas, or present all four operas one at a time over four consecutive nights as a complete Ring. Only the greatest opera companies can afford to mount the complete Ring. The cycle requires the very best musical talents.	1254	The_Ring_of_the_Nibelung	69	443
The Rhine Gold (German: Das Rheingold) is a one-act opera. It is based on German and Scandinavian mythology. Richard Wagner wrote both the words and music. It is the first opera in his four-opera Ring cycle. This cycle tells the story of a hero named Siegfried and of a magic ring that gives its possessor power over the entire world.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	334
After a preview performance in Munich, Germany in 1869, The Rhine Gold officially premiered at the Bayreuther Festspielhaus in August 1876 with the other operas in the cycle. The performance of the complete Ring was a great success. Today, the Ring cycle is considered one of the monumental works of world art.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	310
The Rhine Gold is the first opera in Wagner's cycle of four operas called The Ring of the Nibelung. The cycle follows the life and deeds of the hero Siegfried, and depicts the end of the gods and their way of life. This disaster is brought about by a magic ring. Themes are greed, envy, deceit, and the redemptive power of a woman's love.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	338
The four operas in the cycle are The Rhine Gold, The Valkyrie, Siegfried, and Twilight of the Gods. Wagner started work on the Ring in 1848. He originally thought only to tell of Siegfried's death in an opera eventually called Twilight of the Gods. He decided though that the hero's entire life story had to be told.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	316
"After completing the texts for the last three operas in the cycle, he decided to tell the story of events preceding the hero's life in a ""prelude"" opera, The Rhine Gold. With the texts complete, Wagner began the musical composition of the cycle in performance order. The first opera completed was The Rhine Gold."	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	312
The completion of the Ring was interrupted by the composition of the operas Tristan and Isolde and The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. In 1875, the Bayreuther Festspielhaus was finished with funds from King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Wagner specifically intended this opera house for performances of the Ring. In 1876, the Ring was completed, and went into rehearsal.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	358
The Rhine Gold was first performed at the National Theatre in Munich, Germany on 22 September 1869. Wagner opposed this performance. He wanted the opera to premiere with the other operas in the cycle. His patron, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, however insisted upon this preview performance. The opera later received its premiere as part of the complete Ring cycle on 13 August 1876, in the Bayreuther Festspielhaus, Germany. This world premiere of the complete Ring was an artistic triumph. Today, the cycle is considered a monument of world art.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	543
In the meantime, Alberich has forged a ring from the Rhine Gold. He has enslaved his fellow Nibelung. Loge suggests that this ring (and Alberich's other treasures) be given to the giants instead of Freia. The giants accept this offer. They hold Freia hostage until the debt is paid.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	282
Loge and Wotan go to Alberich's underground home. Wotan takes the ring from him, as well as his other treasures. These treasures include a magic helmet called the Tarnhelm. Alberich curses the ring: worry and death shall be the fate of its possessor.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	250
The giants accept the treasure as payment. They release Freia. Wotan wants to keep the ring. Erda warns him that the ring will destroy the gods. He gives the ring to the giants. Fafner does not want to share the ring, and kills Fasolt. The Rhine Maidens are heard mourning the loss of the Rhine Gold. The gods enter their new home, Valhalla. This is where they hope to live in bliss for eternity, but the seeds of destruction have been sown.	1307	The_Rhine_Gold	69	441
"An orchestra is a group of musicians playing instruments together. They usually play classical music. A large orchestra is sometimes called a ""symphony orchestra"" and a small orchestra is called a ""chamber orchestra"". A symphony orchestra may have about 100 players, while a chamber orchestra may have 30 or 40 players. The number of players will depend on what music they are playing and the size of the place where they are playing. The word ""orchestra"" originally meant the semi-circular space in front of a stage in a ancient Greek theatre which is where the singers and instruments used to play. Gradually the word came to mean the musicians themselves."	4535	Orchestra	69	658
The orchestra is directed by a conductor. He/she helps the players to play together, to get the right balance so that everything can be heard clearly, and to encourage the orchestra to play with the same kind of feeling. Some small chamber orchestras may play without a conductor. This was usual until the 19th century when the orchestras got very big and needed a conductor who made decisions and stood in front so that all the players could see him.	4535	Orchestra	69	451
An orchestral layout. There are various ways of positioning instruments. Quite often the woodwind are in straight lines instead of a curve as in this diagram, and the extra woodwind more often sit with the others: the piccolo with the flutes etc.	4535	Orchestra	69	246
"The instruments of the orchestra are divided into families: the strings, woodwind, brass and percussion. Each section (group of instruments) will have a player who is the ""section principal"". If the music says ""solo"" in their part it is the principal who will play the solo. The principals will make decisions about seating arrangements, and about technical ways of playing the music: for example the principal of the string sections will make sure all the players move their bows up and down in the same direction. The violins are divided into first and second violins. The first violins usually have the tune while the seconds, most of the time, are part of the accompaniment. The principal of the first violins is the leader (or concertmaster) of the orchestra. In a professional orchestra they will be the most highly paid member of the orchestra."	4535	Orchestra	69	851
The strings are the biggest section, although there are only five kinds of instruments: violin, viola, cello, double bass, and harp. This is because they are playing most of the time and usually form the basis of the music. If they are not playing the tune they will probably be accompanying. The first and second violins play different notes: the firsts usually have the tune. The strings sit at the front of the stage in a fan-shape in front of the conductor. The first violins are on the conductor's left, then come the second violins, then the violas and then the cellos. The double basses are behind the cellos. Some conductors prefer to have the second violins on their right and the cellos between the first violins and violas (see image of the Dohnanyi Orchestra).	4535	Orchestra	69	772
The woodwind sit in one or two rows (depending on the size of the orchestra) behind the strings. There are five main woodwind instruments: flute, oboe, clarinet,saxophone, and bassoon. Each of these two instruments also come in different versions:	4535	Orchestra	69	247
The flute has a small version called the piccolo which plays an octave higher. It is the highest instrument in the orchestra. Occasionally there is an alto flute which is longer and plays a fifth (half an octave) lower than the flute. Most woodwind instruments need a reed, but the flute does not have a reed.	4535	Orchestra	69	309
Sometimes a player will double on these extra instruments, for example: one of the flute players may also play the piccolo in the same piece. It depends on the piece of music. Obviously a player cannot play the flute and piccolo at the same time. If the two instruments do play at the same time an extra player will be needed for the piccolo.	4535	Orchestra	69	342
The tuba comes in different sizes and the player or conductor must decide which to use for the piece they are playing. There are large ones called contrabass tubas. A small tuba is commonly also seen and is called a euphonium or a baritone horn.	4535	Orchestra	69	245
"The timpani (or ""kettle drums"") can be tuned to particular notes. They are the most common percussion instrument. Composers such as Haydn and Mozart nearly always used them, even with their small orchestras. This is the most commonly used percussion instruments and is used in almost all pieces."	4535	Orchestra	69	295
The rest of the percussion section can include tuned percussion instruments like the xylophone. Non-tuned percussion can be other kinds of drum like bass drum, snare drum, and a variety of others: cymbal to name the most common ones. In an orchestral work, there can be many percussion instruments but a few players. The principal percussion player will have to decide which player will play which instrument(s). The percussionists have to work well together as a team so all parts can be covered.	4535	Orchestra	69	497
"It is difficult to say when the orchestra was invented because instruments have played together for many centuries. If we say that an orchestra is a group of string instruments with several players playing the same part, and that there may be wind instruments (i.e. woodwind and brass) or percussion playing as well, then the 17th century is the time that orchestras started. In Paris in 1626 King Louis XIII had an orchestra of 24 violins (called ""24 Violons du Roi""). Later in the century the English king Charles II wanted to be like the French king and so he, too, had a string orchestra. Gradually the other instruments were added. At this time there was usually someone playing the harpsichord (the continuo part). It was often the composer himself, who would have conducted from the keyboard at important moments like the beginning and end of the piece."	4535	Orchestra	69	860
Clarinets came into the orchestra at the end of the 18th century, and trombones at the beginning of the 19th century. Orchestras were still quite small, though. The saxophone was invented in the middle of the 19th century, but although they started to use it in orchestras, it soon became an instrument that was used in wind bands and later jazz bands. The opera composer Richard Wagner made the orchestra much bigger because he kept asking for extra instruments. He asked for a bass clarinet in his opera Lohengrin, and for his cycle of four operas called The Ring of the Nibelung he asked for an exact number of players: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, 8 double basses, 3 flutes and piccolo, 3 oboes and cor anglais, 3 clarinets and bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 3 trumpets and bass trumpet, 3 tenor trombones and a double bass trombone, 8 horns with 4 of them playing a specially designed tuba, a bass tuba, percussion, and 6 harps.	4535	Orchestra	69	959
Not all pieces written after that need quite such a large orchestra, but concert halls had become bigger and composers had got used to a bigger variety of sounds. Later composers sometimes added all sorts of unusual instruments: wind machine, sandpaper block, bottles, typewriter, anvils, iron chains, cuckoo, Swannee whistle etc. None of these are normal orchestral instruments. Sometimes a piano is used in the percussion section, e.g. Igor Stravinsky used one in Petrouchka. Sometimes voices are also used.	4535	Orchestra	69	509
Today orchestras can usually be heard in concert halls. They also play in opera houses for opera and ballet, or in a large stadium for huge open-air concerts. Orchestras may record in studios for making CDs or recording music for movies. Many of them can be heard easily and cheaply every summer in London at the BBC Proms.	4535	Orchestra	69	323
Some of the greatest orchestras today include: the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Balmacewen School Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra (Tokyo). Opera houses usually have their own orchestra, e.g. the orchestras of the Metropolitan Opera House, La Scala, or the Royal Opera House.	4535	Orchestra	69	730
In many countries there are opportunities for school-age children who play instruments well to play in youth orchestras in their areas. In Britain some of the very best are selected to play in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Other world-famous youth orchestras include the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar, Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra, the European Union Youth Orchestra and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.	4535	Orchestra	69	425
Airbus is a multinational aerospace company. It is one of biggest plane manufacturers today. It was founded on December 18, 1970 by Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, Fokker and British Aircraft Corporation (BAE). Airbus' last aircraft model is the Airbus A321XLR which is an extended range version of the A321neo. Airbus started replacing CEO models with NEO models which offer more advanced and fuel efficent engines. NEO stands for New Engine Option. Airbus A380	14528	Airbus	70	468
The violin is a string instrument that is played with a bow. The violin has four strings, which are tuned to the notes, G, D, A, and E. The violin is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering, with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers, so players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand by memory alone.	1045	Violin	70	432
The violin is the smallest and highest pitched instrument in the string family. The other instruments in the family are: viola, cello and double bass. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs a violin is called a luthier.	1045	Violin	70	263
The violin is about 400 years old. By the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century the violin was fully developed and it became the most important orchestral instrument. It is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music and in jazz as well as in folk music.	1045	Violin	70	291
In the 17th century there were several families of luthiers who were extremely good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still in existence today. They are some of the best instruments in existence, and can fetch prices of several million dollars.	1045	Violin	70	355
This acts as a resonating box: it amplifies (makes louder) the sound of the vibrating strings. Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body: the front is called the “belly”, the back is the “back”, the sides are the “ribs”.	1045	Violin	70	244
Halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece the strings go across the bridge. The bridge is not fixed onto the violin. It is held in place because the strings are so tight. If the strings are completely loosened the bridge will come away. The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument.	1045	Violin	70	346
Many violins also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest is also used. These are now made of foam, with special legs to hold them on to the violin. As these are not particularly cheap, many beginners instead use a sponge and an elastic band.	1045	Violin	70	296
Gradually the player can learn how to stop the strings with the fingers to get all the different notes. At first the learner will play in “first position”. This means that finger 1 (the fingers are numbered from 1 to 4, the thumb being behind the neck of the instrument) is playing a note which is a whole tone above the open string, e.g. on the D string it is playing a stopped E. When he or she is more advanced they will play in other positions by moving the left hand up the fingerboard nearer to the bridge. There is also a half position in which the first finger is stretched back.	1045	Violin	70	587
The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands, but when playing in chamber music or in orchestras he sits (although this was not always the case). When sitting he may have to turn his right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow.	1045	Violin	70	309
In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák. In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was undoubtedly the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anyone had played before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly (and because of his looks).	1045	Violin	70	425
Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell, and the fiddler (*)	1045	Violin	70	300
(*) The violin is sometimes called a “fiddle”. Someone who plays it is a “fiddler”. There is even a verb: “to fiddle” (meaning: “to play the fiddle”). This word can be used as a nickname for the violin, but is properly used when talking about folk music.	1045	Violin	70	254
Spain is a member state of the European Union and a member state of the eurozone. Spain has influence in Europe and it is a modern and developed state. Its capital city is Madrid, but there are other important cities, such as Barcelona and Valencia.	324	Spain	70	249
Spain is the 13th largest economy in the world and the 4th largest economy in the European Union. The quality life is also include in the top 10. Spain is a victim of a big crisis, like other countries in the EU. Currently, political corruption has become a problem for all of its citizens.	324	Spain	70	290
There is another issue facing Spain's parliament and political system; the Catalan Parliament wants to declare Catalonia's independence from Spain, which would make it a separate country. They already tried to do this once, through a public referendum, but the person who was Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, ruled that the vote organised by the Catalan Parliament was against Spain's constitution and ruled it illegal.	324	Spain	70	426
The referendum still went ahead without the Spanish government's permission. The leader of the Catalan Parliament, Carles Puigdemont, announced the result and declared Catalonia independent. However, this was rejected by the Spanish government and it lead to serious riots in the territory, in which lots of people were hurt. The Catalan Parliament was suspended and some of its senior members were arrested. They are currently on trial on a charge of sedition; this means that they're being tried for speaking or behaving in a way which causes people to rebel against a government or a monarch. Carles Puigdemont is currently in exile in Belgium, to avoid being arrested.	324	Spain	70	672
The Crowns of Castille and Aragon were united as a result of the marriages of Isabella I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon (who were known as the Catholic Monarchs). The Catholic Monarchs ended la Reconquista with the completion of the conquest of the Emirate of Granada en 1492. In this year, Cristopher Columbus also arrived to the New World, on a voyage funded by Queen Isabella, which meant the start of the Spanish Empire. Some important conquistadores (Spanish word for conqueror) include Hernán Cortés, Francisco Pizarro, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca or Diego de Almagro, among others.	324	Spain	70	595
The official language is Spanish. But there are other languages spoken in the country, some of them are official in their respective autonomous communities. This is the case, of the Catalan language (oficial in the region of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands); the Basque language (in the Basque Country and the Chartered Community of Navarre); the Valencian language (official in the Valencian Community) and the Galician language, very closely related to Portuguese, which is official in Galicia.	324	Spain	70	499
"There are also what are called ""short vowels"" (harakat) which are used to show correct pronunciation, for example, the word deen=religion and dayn=owe are normally written exactly the same way (3 letters D Y N) but to make the pronunciation clear deen can be written with a haraka/accent of a little dash under the D like so /. In dayn it can written as a little dash (horizantal) above the [D]."	5337	Arabic_language	70	395
The Arabic script is used in many other languages such as Urdu and Persian. In some of these languages there are added letters (or added dots/slightly different shapes) as in Farsi to compensate for sounds that are not found in the Arabic alphabet.	5337	Arabic_language	70	248
Arabic is spoken across the Middle East, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in North Africa, and in portions of Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. Since Muslims believe the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, can only truly be read in Arabic, it is fairly common for people in other predominantly Islamic countries to understand religious words in Arabic. People of Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, etc.) understand Arabic well, but don't talk it as fluently as others, due to the French colonisations.	5337	Arabic_language	70	513
In the third century B.C.E., Nabateans, a tribe of people in Asia, settled near the northern part of the Arabic Peninsula. They spoke a language very similar to Arabic, however they still wrote in an early language called Aramaic, which was itself closely related to Hebrew.	5337	Arabic_language	70	274
"Around the sixth century C.E., Arabic ""took over"" another language found in the Arabic peninsula, Sabaic, because the chief religious text, the Qur'an, was written and spoken only in Arabic. Although Sabaic exists today as a spoken language, only a small number of people use it."	5337	Arabic_language	70	279
"The most famous and influential book in Arabic is the holy book of Muslims called ""Qur'an"", which Muslims believe was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W) over a period of about 23 years. Muslims hold that he was the last messenger of God. The Qur'an, Islam's holy book is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is regarded widely as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language."	5337	Arabic_language	70	466
"One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of Arabic stories written and adapted over time by many authors. In English this collection is called ""Arabian Nights"" and includes the stories ""Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp,"" ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,"" and ""The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor."""	5337	Arabic_language	70	295
The metric system is a system of measurement that is used around the world. It developed from a system introduced by France in 1791. Before 1791 many towns in France had their own system of measurement. The metric system is based on decimals (units of ten). It was designed to have a logical structure. At first the metric system was based on two quantities. These quantities were length and weight. The basic units were called the metre and the gramme.	4505	Metric_system	70	453
By 1875 many countries in Europe and in Latin America had changed to using the metric system. In 1875 seventeen countries signed the Metre Convention agreeing to share responsibility for defining and managing the metre and kilogram standards. (*)	4505	Metric_system	70	246
"In 1960 the rules for the metric system was revised. The revised system was called the ""International System of Units"" (which is often written ""SI"" for short). The definition of SI also included rules for writing SI quantities. These rules are the same for all languages."	4505	Metric_system	70	271
"The metric system is a decimal-based system of measurement. The system has units of measure for each quantity. The names of most units of measure in the metric system have two parts. One part is the unit name and the other part is the prefix. For example, in the name ""centimetre"", the word ""centi"" is the prefix and the word ""metre"" is the unit name. Sometimes, as with metre, litre and gram, there is no prefix. (*)"	4505	Metric_system	70	417
"In the metric system, all units have a ""symbol"". Symbols are a shorthand way of writing the names of units. All the countries in the world use the same symbol for a unit, even though they might have different ways of writing out the unit name in full. For example"	4505	Metric_system	70	263
The metric system was first developed in France during the French Revolution. A French law passed in 1795 defined five units of measure. Three of these names are still in use today. They are the metre which is the unit of length, the gram which is the unit of mass and the litre which is the unit of volume. (*) The most commonly used units of measure in the metric system are listed below. (*)	4505	Metric_system	70	394
"In the metric system, length is measured in metres. The symbol for the metre is the letter ""m"". The metre was originally defined as being 1⁄10,000,000 of the distance between the North Pole and the Equator on the meridian that passed through Paris. In 1799, a platinum bar that was equal to this length was made and became the ""prototype metre"" (*)"	4505	Metric_system	70	348
"In the metric system, mass is measured in grams. The symbol for the gram is the letter ""g"". In 1795 the French Government defined the gram as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at the freezing point of ice. This was difficult to measure, so in 1799 the French Government made a ""prototype kilogram"" (1000 grams) weight."	4505	Metric_system	70	326
The definitions of the units are often being changed. In 1960 the definition of the metre was changed. Since then it has been defined in terms of the speed of light. (*) At the current time (2014) it is proposed that the kilogram be redefined in terms of the Planck constant.	4505	Metric_system	70	275
In 1875 representatives from the governments of twenty different countries met in Paris to discuss weights and measures. Seventeen of the countries signed a treaty about weights and measures. The treaty was called the Metre Convention. The countries that signed were: Argentine Confederation, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, United States and Venezuela.:75–76 They agreed:	4505	Metric_system	70	478
"To make 40 identical copies of the kilogram. One was chosen as the prototype (or primary) copy. This copy was known as the ""International Prototype Kilogram"". It replaced the Kilogramme des archives as the world's primary copy of the kilogram. The Kilogramme des archives would be kept at the BIPM premises."	4505	Metric_system	70	307
"To make 30 identical copies of the metre. One was chosen as the prototype (or primary) copy. This copy was known as the ""International Prototype Metre"". It replaced the Metre des archives as the world's primary copy of the metre. The Metre des archives would be kept at the BIPM premises."	4505	Metric_system	70	288
"In 1960 the BIPM published the ""International System of Units"" (or SI). SI clarified a number of areas of the metric system, particularly in science and in engineering. The BIPM also standardized the way in which SI was written making it the same for all languages. (*)"	4505	Metric_system	70	269
There are 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint but there are 20 imperial [UK] fluid ounces in an imperial pint. The US fluid ounce is larger than the imperial fluid ounce, but the imperial pint is larger than the US pint. In the 1700s this type situation was common across Europe. Each country measured length, weight/mass and volume in its own way. Sometimes different countries or cities used the same name for different measurements. Sometimes different cities in the same country had different ways of measuring things. In 1789 there were a quarter of a million different units of weight and measure in France. (*) :2–3	4505	Metric_system	70	618
"During the French Revolution the French scientists decided that it would be better to have a new system of weights and measure. The system would be the same in all French provinces and cities. They also decided that it would easier if the new system used 10's instead of 12's, 16's or 20's. This is because people count in 10's. The new system became the official system of measurement in France in 1799.:71–72 One of the French leaders, the Marquis de Condorcet declared that ""[the metric system] is for all people for all time"".:1"	4505	Metric_system	70	532
"They decided that the new system would be for everybody on earth and that the new unit of length would be called a ""metre"". They decided to there would be 10,000,000 metres between the North Pole and the equator. Between 1791 and 1798 two surveyors, Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre, measured the distance from Dunkirk to Barcelona using old French units. They used the stars to measure the latitude of these cities. They used this information to work out that the length of the metre should 443.296 lignes. (*) In 1798 the French scientists made a bar of platinum that was exactly one metre long. They stored this bar in the French archives. It was called the metre des archives. People who made one metre rulers were able to check that their rulers were the same length as the metre des archives. Other scientists made a kilogram weight from platinum which was also put in the archives. This weight was called the kilogram des archives.:266"	4505	Metric_system	70	951
In 1799 the metric system was made compulsory in the region around Paris. This caused a lot of confusion because the police enforced the new measures but customers preferred the old ones. So shopkeepers had to have both. People became worried the new measures were used to cheat them. Politicians tried to educate and convince people to use metric, but the people rejected the metric system. In 1800 the government tried to make the system acceptable by changing the names of the units back to the simpler names used before metrication. For example, the decimetre, centimetre, and millimetre were renamed to palme (hand), doigt (finger) and trait (trace).:270–275	4505	Metric_system	70	663
In 1799 Napoleon became the leader of France. By 1812 he had conquered most of Europe. He introduced the metric system to the countries that he conquered. In 1815 he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. After Napoleon was defeated, most of the countries started using their old systems of measurement again.	4505	Metric_system	70	310
During this time, the metric system was still the official system of measurement in France. And it still had simplified unit names. But the French people continued to use the measures they were used to. The French government tried to persuade the people to convert. They mass-produced metric rulers, they tried to teach the people to use metric measures, and commanded the police to punish people who would not cooperate. Eventually the government stopped trying and withdrew the metric system.:332–333	4505	Metric_system	70	502
On 12 February 1812, France stopped using the metric system and started using a new system called mesures usuelles. The new system was based on many of the old pre-metric units. The old units were redefined to be round numbers or fractions of the withdrawn metric units. For example, the livre (pound) was reintroduced and changed from 489 grams to 500 grams. The toise was redefined as 2 metres. The toise contained 6 pied (feet), changed from 324.8 mm to Template:fraction of a metre (333.33 mm). The pied had 12 pouces (inches) and the pouce had 12 lignes.:334	4505	Metric_system	70	563
During the nineteenth century many small countries started cooperating with each other. In 1815 the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed from seventeen small states. Each state had its own system of measurement. In 1820 they decided that it would be better if everybody used the metric system.	4505	Metric_system	70	294
In 1815 the German Confederation was formed. It was an association of 39 different states. Each state had its own system of measurements. In 1834 the German Confederation formed a customs union called the Zollverein. In 1851 the Zollverein decided to use metric units for trade between the various states. In 1871, most of the states in the German Confederation were joined together to form the German Empire. The German Empire continued to use the metric system.	4505	Metric_system	70	463
By 1875 many European and Latin American counties were already using the metric system. These countries included France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Columbia. Between 1875 and 1914 many more countries including Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Paraguay, Philippines and Vietnam started to use the metric system. In 1917, during the Bolshevik Revolution, the USSR (now Russia) adopted the metric system. By the start of the Second World War most non-English speaking countries had adopted the metric system.	4505	Metric_system	70	548
"In 1866, after most of the South American countries started to use the metric system, the United States passed a law that allowed people to use either the metric system or United States customary units for trade. They were a ""standard yard"" and a ""standard pound ""which were kept by the United States Treasury. In 1893 the United States Congress passed the Mendenhall Order. This order defined the yard as being exactly 3600⁄3937 metres and the pound as being exactly 0.4535924277 kilogram. It had no other effect on people's lives."	4505	Metric_system	70	532
In 1975 the Metric Conversion Act started a formal metrication process. Metrication was to be voluntary. It was to be coordinated by the U.S. Metric Board. In 1988 the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act said that metric units had to be used for all federal projects. The Act did not apply to state projects. Some states demanded that metric units be used but other states did not. Some industries changed to using metric units but others did not. Soft drinks are sold in metric quantities. Milk is sold in customary units. Metric units are widely used in the design of motor cars. Aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were designed using mainly customary units.	4505	Metric_system	70	670
Some people want to use the metric system because it will make it easier to export goods. Other people say that metrication can only work if all fifty states metricate at the same time. This will not happen unless the Federal Government takes the lead.	4505	Metric_system	70	252
In 1897 the United Kingdom passed a law allowing people to use either the metric system or Imperial units for trade. By the late 1960s three quarters of British exports were to countries that used the metric system. However people in the United Kingdom still used imperial units. The Metrication Board was set up in 1969 to help Britain change to the metric system. Each company had to pay their own expenses. Some companies saved a lot of money by changing to the metric system because they could make the same goods for export as they made for sales in the United Kingdom. For example, almost all motor cars use metric-sized nuts and bolts. Other companies lost money because they had to make many changes but did not have any benefit from the changes.	4505	Metric_system	70	754
When the metrication Board was closed down in 1981 most of government and industry had changed to the metric system but a lot of everyday things like road signs had not been changed. A survey taken in 2013 showed that metric units and imperial units were both widely used by British people in their private lives.	4505	Metric_system	70	313
Ancient Rome is the name for a civilization which began as a small farming community in the 10th century BC Italy. It grew to become the largest empire in the ancient world. (*) It started as a monarchy, then became a republic, then an empire.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	243
The Roman Empire was so big that there were problems ruling a territory which stretched from Britain to the Middle East. In 293 AD, Diocletian split the empire into two parts. A century later, in 395 AD, it was permanently split into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	288
The Western Empire ended because of the Germanic tribe, the Visigoths in 476 AD. In the 5th century AD, the western part of the empire split up into different kingdoms. The eastern Roman Empire stayed together as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire would be defeated by the Ottoman Empire in 1453.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	304
Roman culture spread to Western Europe and the area around the Mediterranean Sea. Its history still has a big influence on the world today. For example, Roman ideas about laws, government, art, literature, and language are important to European culture. The Roman language, Latin, slowly evolved becoming modern French, Spanish, Italian, and Romanian, and influenced many other languages like English.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	401
Beginning with Emperor Nero in the first century AD, the Roman government did not like Christianity. At some points, people could be put to death because they were Christians. Under Emperor Diocletian, the persecution of Christians because the strongest. However, Christianity became an officially supported religion in the Roman Empire under Constantine I, who was the next Emperor. With the signing of the Edict of Milan in 313, it quickly became the biggest religion. All religions except Christianity were banned in 391 AD by an edict of Emperor Theodosius I.

The Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam, whose followers took over the territories of Syria, Armenia and Egypt and soon threatened to take over Constantinople. (*) In the next century, the Arabs also captured southern Italy and Sicily.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	247
The Byzantines, however, managed to stop Islamic invader from moving further into their lands during the 8th century and, beginning in the 9th century, took parts of the conquered lands back over. (*) In 1000 AD, the Eastern Empire was at its largest point: Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. (*) However, the expansion was suddenly stopped in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert. This finally made the empire start becoming weaker. Several centuries of fighting and Turkic invasions ultimately made it possible for Emperor Alexius I Comnenus to send a call for help to the West in 1095.	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	625
The West responded with the Crusades, eventually resulting in the Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 split what little land remained in the Empire into new countries, the ultimate winner being Nicaea. (*) After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453. (*)	5666	Ancient_Rome	71	498
"The word ""egg"" is used to refer to several things: in the usual sense, the egg is an object laid by female birds, hens in particular. It is surrounded by a shell, and a fledgling (chick) emerges after some time: it's hatching. The hen's egg, notably, is also a food."	5185	Egg	73	266
But other animals such as turtles, fish... also lay eggs, not necessarily in a shell, to breed. For scientists, an egg is a cell, the first of a new individual, the outcome of fertilisation; according to this definition, all animals have eggs!	5185	Egg	73	243
The chicken egg is surrounded by an ovoid shell, white or cream-brown in color, hard but thin. Inside, there is a colorless viscous substance, the white, and the yolk, which is a small sphere. It will later hatch into a chick if fertilization occurs. The yolk contains nutrients which allow the chick to grow, and the white is a liquid in which the chick lives for several weeks until it hatches.	5185	Egg	73	396
A hen can also lay eggs without having mated with a rooster: in this case, the egg can not provide a chick (for scientists, it is not a real egg) but you can eat it anyway. Chickens are raised for their eggs A hen can lay about an egg a day in a period of more or less one year in length. Some breeds are selected because they lay a lot.	5185	Egg	73	337
But we also need eggs in order to have hens, since hens and chickens come from eggs. A hen must incubate her eggs so that the chicks can hatch: the hen sits on the eggs, paying attention not to break them, in order to warm them. If they stay at a good temperature for long enough, the chicks can develop.	5185	Egg	73	304
Birds lay a variable number of eggs per year, usually at once: this is what we call the brood. For example, the blackbird lays between 2 and 6 eggs per brood, and the golden eagle between 1 and 3. In most species, the female stays on the nest to brood, while the male goes in search of food for her: this prevents the eggs from being discovered and raided by predators. In certain species, it is the male who broods, or sometimes both of them.	5185	Egg	73	443
Snakes, turtles, crocodiles ... lay eggs. They also have a shell, but unlike the eggs of birds, it is rather soft. Reptiles also make nests, but they do not incubate their eggs. In general, the nest is dug in the sand, like turtles and lizards, or consists of a simple pile of branches. Temperature is also very important, as in birds: if the nest is too hot or cold, the eggs of the crocodile will be male or female!	5185	Egg	73	417
Dinosaurs also laid eggs, of which fossils have been found. The ancestors of mammals, and even some living mammals lay eggs! They form the group of monotremes: these are the duck-billed platypus and the echidna. They lay eggs, then produce milk at their babies' hatching to feed them: these are therefore definitely mammals.	5185	Egg	73	324
Many other animals lay eggs, such as fish, amphibians, and insects, but these eggs are very different from those that have been described, and they have no shell. These eggs are generally laid in very great numbers, because since they are fragile, they can be easily eaten by predators.	5185	Egg	73	286
For scientists, an egg is a cell which allows reproduction: when a sperm encounters an egg cell, they fusion (which is fertilization), and make a new cell called an egg, or zygote. It's the first cell of a new living being. It will divide and grow to become a new animal.	5185	Egg	73	271
As a result, the unfertilized egg, which is laid by hens that have not mated with a rooster, it isnot really an egg: to be an egg, you need an ovule, and a spermatozoon, which is produced by the rooster. Since there is no rooster, it's not an egg, but rather an ovule, even if it's surrounded by a shell like an egg.	5185	Egg	73	316
"Among many aquatic species, like fish and amphibians, the female lays ""eggs"" that the male fertilizes in the water: these are therefore not really eggs that the female is laying, but rather ova! Among other species, such as birds, it is necessary for the male and the female to mate before the eggs can be laid. The ova are fertilized in the body of the female and become eggs before being laid."	5185	Egg	73	395
The shelled eggs of birds, reptiles and mammals are called amniotic eggs by scientists. Their shell, which prevents them from drying out, allows them to survive on land rather than in the water. The existence of this egg allows scientists, in terms of classification, to classify birds, reptiles and mammals in the same group: the Amniotes.	5185	Egg	73	340
The egg also generally contains a lot of reserves, which serve to feed the baby animal: a chick, for example, will have to spend several weeks in the egg feeding on its yolk. In other species, such as mammals, the egg contains fewer reserves, or even none at all: the human egg is so small that it requires a microscope to see it. Instead, it remains in the mother's womb, where it can feed via the umbilical cord: we therefore also make eggs, even if we do not lay them: they develop in the womb of the mother, who gives birth once the child is fully formed.	5185	Egg	73	559
It is a bit of a philosophical question, that is often asked: since a chicken hatches from an egg, and since the egg itself was laid by a chicken, it is not easily seen how this could first started. It is necessary to look for the answer in evolution: species change slowly over the course of time, and new species appear. The chicken's ancestor was not a chicken, but an other prehistoric bird, which closely resembled it and which, specifically, also laid eggs. Over time, these animals gradually changed, until, finally, they were no longer part of the same species, but a new one: the chicken. The first chicken was therefore clearly hatched from an egg, but this egg was not laid by a chicken, but by the chicken's ancestor. If an answer needs to be given, it is therefore the egg which came before the chicken. Moreover, the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals were already laying eggs long before there were chickens!	5185	Egg	73	928
The number 0 corresponds to eggs produced at an organic farm. Number 1 comes from a for profit farm called a red label where the hens have access to an open pasture. The number 2 is given to the eggs produced by hens raised with access to the ground ; as he described in section 4 of the eggs from hens in battery cages. The letters that follow this figure correspond to the two first letters of the country of origin	5185	Egg	73	417
To easily verify if an egg is fresh, there is a simple way We plunge the egg in water If it sinks, the egg is extra fresh If the egg floats between the water it is fresh If it remains on the surface it is certainly expired or at least doubtful This is due to the increasing volume of the pocket of air contained in the egg in the course of its ageing	5185	Egg	73	350
In addition to chicken eggs, we also eat eggs of other birds, like the duck or quail. They can be cooked in the same way, but as they are not the same size (a duck egg is larger and a quail egg is smaller than a chicken egg), they are not very practical to use for pastries. In a cake, for example, you would have to change all of the other quantities. They also take longer to cook; for example, 1.5 hours for a soft-boiled ostrich egg!	5185	Egg	73	437
Fabergé eggs are a series of precious, jeweled eggs, initially created by jeweler Pierre-Karl Fabergé, at the request of Tsar Alexandre III for his wife. For more than 50 years, the tsar Alexander III, then his son, Nicolas II, would commission an egg per year from Fabergé, as Easter gifts for their wives. Other Fabergé eggs have since been made.	5185	Egg	73	348
"Humpty Dumpty is a traditional English nursery rhyme character, who is often represented as an egg. He famously appears in the story ""Through the Looking Glass"" (the continuation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). In the nursery rhyme, Humpty Dumpty is sitting on a wall, falls, and breaks."	5185	Egg	73	293
Prehistory is generally divided into several periods: the Paleolithic, which is the most ancient and the longest period, then the Neolithic. These periods can be divided into more precise periods. When prehistoric sites are studied with precision, they are classified not only by period, but by culture. In this sense, a culture is a way of life, a set of techniques used by people to live and shelter themselves, and that are recognized by objects typical of that culture. It certainly also was some beliefs, language and traditions, but we no longer have any traces of these.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	577
During this time, Paleolithic men were hunter-gatherers and nomads. Their homes or shelters must be made quickly, they do not last long and are very rudimentary. For this reason, but also because the materials used are deteriorating fast and that thy are ancient times, it is very difficult to find traces of these houses. They also used natural shelters such as rock shelters.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	377
A tent from the last part of the paleolithic era, covered by non-tanned skinThis same tent reconstituted (smaller) from that information. It could be covered with bark or animal skins. Traces showed that the fire was ahead of the entrance of the tent.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	251
Traces of habitats and the remains of daily activity of Paleolithic have been found most often in the ground of rock shelters, that is to say open or shallow caves. Groups settled and lived there. Over the centuries, remains and waste of these people were deposited on top of each other, which eventually protected traces and older objects that have been covered like this for thousands of years. The same traces and objects when they were left on an ordinary field disappeared, destroyed or washed away by erosion.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	515
Deep caves such as Lascaux cave were however not inhabited. People only went down in them temporarily, but the rock shelters were regularly inhabited since we have found on their ground many objects made by men, and the remains of the animals they hunted.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	255
The Neolithic period begins when men became farmers, breeders and sedentary. Since they do not change place anymore, and their techniques and knowledge are more developed, their houses can, therefore, be more solid and well crafted. The materials that are more often used are always the wood and the thatch for the roof, but also earth for the walls, or even stones.	5313	Prehistoric_house	73	366
It was built in three main phases, each between about 3100 BC and 1950 BC. The first circle, ~3000 BC, was made of timber. The post holes for the timber have been found. Around 2600 BC, the builders gave up timber in favour of stone. Most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 BC. (*)	4384	Stonehenge	73	299
The first stone circle was a set of 'bluestones'. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today. The bluestones (made of a rock called dolerite), were thought for much of the 20th century to have been brought from the Preseli Hills, 260 kilometres away in modern-day Pembrokeshire, Wales. Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by a glacier. (*)	4384	Stonehenge	73	448
Later, ~2400 BC, 30 huge grey sarsen stones were brought to the site. They were erected in a circle 33 metres in diameter, with lintels on top of the standing stones. The remaining blue circles were placed as an inner circle. The site was in use until the Bronze Age. The modern Stonehenge consists entirely of original stones, some of which have been replaced in upright position.	4384	Stonehenge	73	381
No one knows exactly who built Stonehenge or why they built it. During the summer solstice, the sunrise lines up with some of the stones in a particular way. This suggests that the arrangement of stones may work as a calendar. In Egypt and South America, similar ancient buildings can be found. They also show the time of the solstice.	4384	Stonehenge	73	335
"A university is an institution where teaching and research is done. The word university comes from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, roughly meaning ""community of teachers and scholars."" (*) People can attend university to get a degree. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialized. A person studying biology at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields, like languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research."	4495	University	74	536
The universities were born in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first institution of this type was the University of Bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education. (*) (*) (*) This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought, although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages.	4495	University	74	362
"At first, the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages, they remained tied to the Catholic Church. At the beginning, they had worked to teach the so-called ""seven liberal arts"" (the trivium and the quadrivium):"	4495	University	74	300
A university can include several campuses, or different places where classes are taught. In each campus there are several faculties and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms, and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree.	4495	University	74	475
A planet is a large object such as Jupiter or Earth that orbits a star. It is smaller than a star, and it does not make light. Planets are ball-shaped (spheres). Objects that orbit planets are called moons. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto used to be known as a planet, but in August 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided it was a dwarf planet instead. There are four more known dwarf planets in the Solar System, Ceres, Makemake, Eris and Haumea.	5103	Planet	74	478
"The name ""planet"" is from the Greek word πλανήτης (planetes), meaning ""wanderers"", or ""things that move"". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System. As of June 2011, we know of 563 other planets. (*) All of these newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are extrasolar planets. Sometimes people call them ""exoplanets""."	5103	Planet	74	349
The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek or Roman gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: Terra. Other languages, for example Chinese, use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology, or from the plays written by Shakespeare.	5103	Planet	74	389
Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII of England and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Boleyn was executed in 1536. After Anne's death, the king said she should no longer be treated as his daughter. Her half-sister, Mary, daughter of Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry, was in the same position.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	309
King Henry married Jane Seymour who had a baby son. He was named Edward. According to the Salic Law, the throne could not pass to a female descendant if there was a male heir, even if the female was older or had a more direct claim to the throne, so Edward became heir to the throne.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	283
In 1547, King Henry died. Elizabeth's younger half-brother, Edward, became King Edward VI of England. Because King Henry had no other children, he left a will saying that, if Edward had no children of his own, Mary would be queen after him, and Elizabeth would be queen after Mary. Edward died in 1553, when he was only fifteen. Mary then became Queen Mary I of England.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	370
During Mary's reign, life became difficult for Elizabeth. Mary was a Roman Catholic and she married King Philip II of Spain, also a Roman Catholic. This marriage made her unpopular because Spain and England were old enemies. Mary wanted everyone else in England to be Roman Catholic again, so she tried to make Elizabeth attend Roman Catholic services. Because of the argument over religion, many people in the country preferred Elizabeth to Mary and wanted to make her queen. She was accused of trying to take Mary's throne, and was briefly put into the Tower of London.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	571
"At Mary's death, Elizabeth became the Queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth has been called the ""Virgin Queen"", because she never married. As Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain had caused a lot of problems, Elizabeth did not want to make the same mistake in marrying a foreign ruler. She played the political games with the prospect of marrying one prince or another."	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	365
Most people believe that she was in love with Robert Dudley, the 1st Earl of Leicester. Elisabeth and Dudley were both prisoners in the Tower of London during Queen Mary's reign. Robert Dudley was married to Amy Robsart but she died in an accident not long after Elizabeth became queen. Some people said that her husband had arranged for her to be killed so he would be free to marry Queen Elizabeth. This gossip made it impossible for Elizabeth to marry him. She decided that she would not marry at all.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	504
The person with the most legitimate claim to follow Elizabeth to the throne of England was her cousin, Mary Stuart, who was Queen of Scotland. But Mary was a Catholic and Elizabeth was a Protestant. Mary married a French prince and in 1560, became Queen of France, for only one year, as well as Queen of Scots. Some people wanted to force Elizabeth off the throne and replace her with Mary. Mary was a danger to Elizabeth's bid for power.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	438
Because many Scottish people were Protestants, they did not like Mary and revolted against her. She was put in prison and her infant son James was made King of Scotland in her place. He became James VI. In 1568, Mary escaped and fled to England, to ask for help from Elizabeth.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	277
Elizabeth I fell ill in February 1603. She was suffering from physical weakness and insomnia. She had no children, and named James VI of Scotland her successor. Elizabeth I died at the age of 69, on 24 March 1603. She is buried in Westminster Abbey.	518	Elizabeth_I_of_England	74	249
"A religion is a set of beliefs that is held by a group of people. There are many different religions, each with a different set of beliefs. The beliefs are about the world and the people in it, about how they came into being, and what their purpose is. These beliefs are most often linked to ""supernatural"" beings such as a god, a number of gods or spirits. Each religion has different ideas about these things. Each religion also has a ""moral code"" which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act. Each religion usually has their own type of ""devotions"" when people worship or pray. They often have religious ""rituals"" (special things that are always done in the same way) for certain times of the year or certain times of a person's life. (*)"	5687	Religion	74	750
Aspects of religion include narrative, symbolism, beliefs, and practices that are supposed to give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life. Whether the meaning centers on a deity or deities, or an ultimate truth, (*) religion is commonly identified by the practitioner's prayer, ritual, meditation, music and art, among other things, and is often interwoven with society and politics. It may focus on specific supernatural, metaphysical, and moral claims about reality (the cosmos and human nature) which may yield a set of religious laws and ethics and a particular lifestyle. Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural traditions, writings, history, and mythology, as well as personal faith and religious experience.	5687	Religion	74	733
"The term ""religion"" refers both to the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction. ""Religion"" is sometimes used interchangeably with ""faith"" or ""belief system,"" (*) but it is more socially defined than personal convictions, and it entails specific behaviors, respectively."	5687	Religion	74	345
Religion is the word used for a number of cultural phenomena. These phenomena have an influence on thought; very often, religious ideas are the basis of behaviour: Religions often define what is right, and what is wrong. There is no definition of religion that is accepted by all scientists.	5687	Religion	74	291
Very often, religions are based on tradition. Many religions have rituals that need to be performed by the followers of the given religion. Religions have had a great influence on the arts. (*) Many say there are supernatural beings, usually called gods, or spirits. For some, there is just one, often called god. Other religions speak about principles, such as Dao or Dharma, or they tell about the past or future of Mankind, such as Nirvana, or the Afterlife.	5687	Religion	74	461
It looks like people have had religions for a very long time. The first traces of religions can be found with hominids like homo sapiens and Neanderthals. They started to bury their dead in special ways, about 120.000 years ago. Homo sapiens soon started to be different with the things they gave to the dead. Many works of art were found with burials. Starting about 40.000 years ago, the artworks become more common. Today scientists believe these artifacts had a religious significance. Finding the meaning may be hard, as these people did not have writing yet.	5687	Religion	74	564
(*) The whole experience of a religion can give a systemic and stable character to human life and society; thus a religion may also be thought of as a cultural system. While religion is difficult to define, the standard model of religion as used in religious studies was defined by Clifford Geertz (Religion as a Cultural System, 1973). For an influential critique of Geertz's model see Talal Asad's The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category (1982).	5687	Religion	74	467
A Midsummer Night's Dream is a play by William Shakespeare. It is a comedy, and was probably written early in Shakespeare's theatrical career in London. The date the play was written is uncertain, but scholars believe that it was written some time between 1590 and 1596. The date of the play's first performance is unknown, but Dream was very likely staged shortly after its completion. Some authorities believe that the play was written to celebrate an aristocratic marriage, but there is no evidence to support this belief.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	525
Shakespeare generally used the stories, plays, and historical accounts of other writers as sources for his plays, but A Midsummer Night's Dream is completely his own invention. He did however use English folklore to create the play's fairy world. He also used the ancient myth of Pyramus and Thisbe for the play within a play in Act V. The play has been adapted to movies, musical works, operas, and ballets.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	408
"Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of the Fairies, and Puck, Oberon's mischief-making servant are a few characters in the play known to every schoolboy in the world. Bottom the weaver is one of Shakespeare's masterpieces of characterization. Well-known lines from the play include ""The course of true love never did run smooth"", ""I know a bank where the wild thyme blows"", and ""Lord, what fools these mortals be!"""	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	417
William Shakespeare was an English writer and poet. He was born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, and attended the grammar school there. He died there in 1616. He married Anne Hathaway in Stratford. They were the parents of three children: Judith, Susannah, and Hamnet.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	276
Shakespeare spent most of his adult life in London writing 37 to 39 comedies, tragedies, and history plays for the Globe and other theatres. He also wrote a collection of short poems called sonnets and several longer poems. Some scholars have raised questions about Shakespeare's authorship of two or three plays.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	313
He retired to Stratford and died there in 1623. He is buried beneath the floor of the parish church in Stratford. This gravesite is visited by thousands of people annually. Shortly after his death, Shakespeare's London friends collected his plays and poems, and published them in a large volume now called the First Folio.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	322
The world's greatest actors, directors, composers, and designers have all been attracted to Shakespeare's plays. His works have been translated into dozens of languages, and have had tremendous influence upon the writers and poets who followed him.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	248
The Globe Theatre was built in London in 1599 by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. A fire destroyed the Globe on 29 June 1613. This fire was said to have started when the theatre's thatched roof was set ablaze by a cannon fired during a performance of Shakespeare's Henry VIII.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	302
"Many of Shakespeare's greatest plays were first performed in this theatre. A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614. It closed in 1642. A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named ""Shakespeare's Globe"", opened in 1997 about 750 feet (230 metres) from the site of the original theatre."	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	306
The setting is ancient Athens and a forest near it. The time is four days before Midsummer Day, May 1. Two young aristocrats, Lysander and Hermia, are in love, but Hermia's father wants her to marry a man named Demetrius. Hermia does not love Demetrius. Helena, Hermia's best friend, is in love with Demetrius, but Demetrius is not in love with her.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	349
One night, Lysander and Hermia leave Athens quietly to seek shelter miles away with Lysander's aunt. Demetrius follows the two through the forest surrounding Athens. The lovesick Helena follows Demetrius. All four young people become lost and confused in the shadows of the forest.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	281
Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of the Fairies, have assembled their court in the forest. The two monarchs are quarreling. Titania stubbornly stands her ground in the quarrel, and the two part angrily. Oberon vows to take revenge on Titania for her stubbornness.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	269
Oberon sees the lovelorn Helena, and takes pity on her. He orders Puck to put the magical juice of a flower on Demetrius' eyes. This juice will make him fall in love with Helena. Puck makes the mistake of putting the juice on Lysander's eyes, and he falls in love with Helena! Both young ladies are in great distress.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	317
Adding to the confusion are a group of amateur actors from Athens. They have chosen the moonlit forest as the place to rehearse their play, but Puck gives Bottom, one of the actors, the head of a donkey. Titania falls in love with this man-donkey after Oberon puts the magic juice in her eyes. He was hoping she would return to loving him!	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	339
Oberon finally restores order. He causes Demetrius to fall in love with Helena, he causes Lysander to return to his sweetheart Hermia, he takes the donkey's head from Bottom, and finally he causes Titania to fall in love again with her royal husband. Dawn breaks, and the four young lovers return to Athens to be married. The amateur actors also return to Athens. Their play is performed at the wedding celebrations.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	416
The play has always been very popular. Most productions staged the play as a spectacle with elaborate costumes and scenery. In the middle 19th century, the German composer Felix Mendelssohn wrote several pieces of orchestral music for the play including the popular concert piece, A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture and the famous Wedding March.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	345
In the 1935, Warner Bros. made a movie of A Midsummer Night's Dream. It was directed by Max Reinhardt and William Dieterle, and stars Ian Hunter, James Cagney, Mickey Rooney, Olivia de Havilland, Joe E. Brown, Dick Powell, and Victor Jory. Other movies were made in 1909, 1959, 1968, and 1999.	1184	A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream	75	293
Quebec (French: Québec) is a province in southeastern Canada. In 2014, it had 8,191,946 peoples, called Quebecois. (*) With an area of about 1 667 441 square kilometers, Quebec is the biggest of the ten provinces of Canada. It's also the only one whose the official language is French. The other ones are English-speaking (people speak English there) or even bilingual, like New Brunswick. There are many anglophone people in Quebec, mainly in Montreal. It is the second most populated province of Canada after its neighbour Ontario.	3919	Quebec	75	533
Quebec is bordered by the Hudson Strait to the north, Labrador (part of Newfoundland and Labrador) to the east, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and New Brunswick to the southeast, the United States to the south, Ontario to the southwest, and the Hudson Bay to the northwest.	3919	Quebec	75	269
It is led by a prime minister elected by the citizens of the province. Currently the prime minister is Phillipe Couillard, who is also the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec (PLQ). As the province of Quebec is also part of Canada, it is led by the Prime Minister of Canada.	3919	Quebec	75	276
The sovereignism of the Quebec people aims to make Quebec a sovereign state, independent of the Canadian confederation. The Quebecer sovereignism claims to express the will of the Quebecer people that it is recognized as an independent country, first by its own citizens, then by the Canadian confederation and, finally, by the rest of the world.	3919	Quebec	75	346
Its motives are coming from the fact that Quebec is the only territory with a francophone majority in North America and it indicates a unique important culture. Given its economic strength ( among the 20 leading in the world according to the latest estimations) the sovereignists of Quebec believe that Quebec deservse to speak and act for itself on the international stage.	3919	Quebec	75	374
The Europeans arrived on the territory of Quebec in the XVth century. It was already inhabited by thousands of years by the Amerindians who were maybe remote descendants of people come from Asia. In his arrival in 1534, the explorer Jacques Cartier gained ownership of the territory in the name of France.	3919	Quebec	75	305
But many British also wanted to own land of the territory of Quebec. So there have been many wars and battles between the French and the British for the leadership. Finally the British took it in 1759. One of the most memorable battles took place on the Plains of Abraham, on September 13, 1759, two general opposing: Montcalm for the French and Wolf for the British. Both died after the battle: even today, one can see a monument in their memory on the Plains of Abraham This battle marked the start of the English Conquest and the end of French regime.	3919	Quebec	75	554
There are four seasons in Quebec : spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring is the most important season in Quebec, because all the living things return to their normal lives; autumn is a season filled with majestic colors, such as orange, red, green, and yellow; winters are very cold and summers very nice. The winter of 2010 was the warmest in 60 years. But in 2007-2008, Quebec established a record with more than 5 meters of snow.	3919	Quebec	75	436
The exploitations of natural resources is very important in Quebec. The development of potential hydroelectric has allowed to create many jobs. After the great hydroelectric center at the north coast, Hydro-Quebec built dams on the Grande Rivière, near the James bay, around 1980. Hydro-Quebec exports its excess electricity to the United States.	3919	Quebec	75	346
The wheel was invented in prehistoric times and probably its discovery was repeated many times independently. The oldest example of a wheel yet found is from the region of Mesopotamia (Iraq), so it may have been invented around the area where Iraq is today. The wheel may have been inspired by a simple observation of a rolling tree trunk. When a number of tree trunks are placed on the ground close together, and a weight is placed upon them, the object can be moved much more easily. The rolling trunks cause less friction than dragging the object on the ground.	4205	Wheel	75	564
The first wheels were indeed tree trunks. The next development was to use slices of these trunks joined together through an axle. Later, these wheels became wooden disks cut into a circular shape with a hole for the axle. The oldest wooden wheel archaeologists have found was built somewhere between 3350 and 3100 BC. Because the first wheels were made from wood, and wood rots and breaks down over time, we can assume that other wheels might have existed earlier.	4205	Wheel	75	464
A wheel works by rolling. Rolling is an efficient way to reduce friction. When you slide a block across a smooth surface, it will slide for a short distance and then come to a stop. When you roll a ball across that surface, it will roll a long way.	4205	Wheel	75	248
There are two basic parts of wheels; the wheel and the axle. The wheel itself is a round disk. The axle is a shaft positioned in the center of the disk. Sometimes the disk itself spins on the axle. Often the axle is fixed to the disk and the wheel and axle turn together.	4205	Wheel	75	271
When a wheel is rolling along the ground, a fraction of the surface touches the ground. Yet this surface doesn't have to slide on the ground. Friction mainly occurs in the axle and are greatly reduced. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction. By rolling, wheels make it easier to move things from place to place.	4205	Wheel	75	326
The invention of the wheel was of great importance not only as a transportation device, but for the development of technology in general, important applications including the water wheel used in watermill, the gear, and the spinning wheel. More modern descendants of the wheel include the propeller, the gyroscope and the turbine.	4205	Wheel	75	330
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is one of the most famous telescopes. It is the first optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground, because the atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches earth. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 2.4 meters across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	534
It actually observes less than 20% of the time. It was made by both NASA and the ESA working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched April 24 1990. It completes a full orbit of Earth every 97 minutes. That means it travels at 5 miles (10 km) per second. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes.	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	372
When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right, but only by 2.2 micrometres (1/50th as thick as a piece of paper). Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was nearsighted. (*)	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	537
Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used. It took five days of space walks. When astronaut Story Musgrave opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close, so Musgrave and the other astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed.	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	495
Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	287
Hubble will soon be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will fly even higher above the Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars. (*)	5694	Hubble_Space_Telescope	76	290
A toilet works because of gravity. When a flush lever is pulled, a plug will open, allowing water to flow out to fill the basin. Then the gravity causes the liquid to flow out of the basin through a bend in the pipe, called an S trap. The flush cleans the bowl of the toilet, and under the rim where it is difficult to reach. It carries waste matter to a drain, which then takes it to a treatment plant or septic tank.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	418
"The ""'float ball""' rises as the tank fills with water. As it rises, the float rod attached to it presses against the inlet valve. When the tank is full, the rod is pressing against the inlet valve hard enough to turn the water off. This stops the tank from overflowing."	4008	Flush_toilet	76	269
Some of the clean water coming behind remains at the bottom of the toilet bowl. That's because modern toilets have an 'S' bend which remains filled with water between flushing. The water in the 'S' bend stops bad odours escaping from the drainpipe. During flushing the 'S' bend also provides siphon action which helps speed up the flushing process.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	348
However, some toilet flushing can produce very small droplets of water known as aerosols. These aerosols can contain bacteria and viruses that are in the toilet. Because the aerosols float through the air, there is a risk of becoming infected. This has been believed to be a cause for outbreak of atypical pneumonia within several high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong that are close to each other.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	405
Different toilets use different amounts of water per flush, depending on the country or the period. Older models in some countries use 13 or even 19 liters per flush while newer models use 6 liters per flush. Today, some well-designed 6 liter toilets flush better than lesser toilets that use 2-3 times more water per flush. The design of the surfaces that control the flow of water make a big difference.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	405
Some toilets have extra fixtures such as grab-bars for wheelchair users. Some toilets have a water jet built into them like a bidet. Some have heated seats, and lids that open and close automatically. And some will even check your blood pressure and temperature.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	262
Toilets come in many different types. There are chemical toilets, which use chemicals to neutralize the waste instead of water. There are composting toilets, which do not use water and turn the waste into natural compost. There are even incinerating toilets, which burn the waste.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	280
The flush toilet were first used in parts of India and Pakistan about 2,700 years ago. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece. There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company. Toilets are usually connected to a septic tank, or to a sewer.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	569
In 1775 Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap, which is still used today, that used standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. His design had a sliding valve in the bowl outlet above the trap.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	247
Some ideas and inventions had to be developed before it could be created: To have a flush toilet in one's house, first of all one has to have fresh and clean water supply. A better organization of the cities was needed for that. The lever and the siphon also had to be invented before the flush toilet could have come into being.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	329
WC helps public health of today to keep higher standards than in the past. That allows us today to live in much bigger cities than in the past, not being afraid of getting sick: beyond a certain population cities and villages would be at risk of epidemics before toilets were widespread.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	287
Big cities were a requirement to start the industrial revolution in the 1800s. Although WC seems to be an invention of minor importance, its impact to our modern world was quite great. The toilet has also created a whole new profession like plumber and his associated industry.	4008	Flush_toilet	76	277
In Egypt, kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as tombs for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today. (*)	5555	Pyramid	76	258
The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It was near Cairo. It was the tallest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) from the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. It took twenty years to build.	5555	Pyramid	76	467
People thought pyramids were built by slaves. More recently evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, some of the most famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. There were once many valuable items buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the afterlife. Pyramids usually had traps to stop thieves from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures.	5555	Pyramid	76	614
The ancient Greeks called the great pyramid one of the seven wonders of the world. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them can be found on the western side of the River Nile. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years.	5555	Pyramid	76	352
The 32-story Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee (a city named after the ancient Egyptian capital whose name itself was derived from the name of one of its pyramids). Built in 1991, it was the home court for the University of Memphis men's basketball program and the National Basketball Association's Memphis Grizzlies until 2004.	5555	Pyramid	76	330
There are also ancient pyramids in other parts of Africa, Central America, Europe, North America, and Asia. There is a famous modern glass pyramid in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The Luxor Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada is also a glass pyramid.	5555	Pyramid	76	249
Joan of Arc, called the Maid or the Maid of Orleans, was born in Domrémy (Lorraine) on the 5th or 6 January 1412. She was burned alive in Rouen on May 30, 1431 at the age of only 19. Joan of Arc was a woman who lived in France during the Hundred Years' War and fought for the King of France, Charles VII.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	304
Eldest of five children, she was very religious. She often would go to church to pray. When she was 13, she told of hearing the voices of saints and archangels. These voices whispered to her to go and meet the Dauphin Charles VII, then ousted from the succession to the throne of France by his rival, the King of England. The voices told her to liberate France from the invaders (the English) and to crown the Dauphin at Rheims.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	428
Despite the reluctance of her family, she managed to leave Lorraine, crossed France and met Charles at Chinon. She overcame the reluctance of the King and his entourage by her candor, her faith, her confidence and the enthusiasm that she aroused in the people. Charles agreed to let her go to Orleans to break the siege made there by the English. She managed to restore the confidence of the exhausted French soldiers and the attackers abandoned the siege on the night of the 7th or 8 May 1429.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	494
After that victory, Jeanne convinced the Dauphin to crown himself King at Reims, the city where the Kings of France have traditionally been crowned for centuries, but situated in the middle of territory controlled by the enemy. The victory at Orleans restored confidence in the Dauphin's cause and the population, although dominated by the English, let them pass. The Dauphin was crowned on the 17 of July 1429	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	410
After that, Jeanne continued the war. She failed to retake Paris, held by the supporters of the Duke of Bourgogne. She was captured on May 23, 1430 at Compiegne by the Duke of Bourgogne's soldiers and then sold to the English. As much as the French saw in Jeanne the incarnation of divine will, the English saw in her a sinner dedicated to the devil. They brought a heresy trial against her, but only succeeded in accusing her of a few faults: wearing men's clothes and leaving her parents without permission. Frightened by the judges, Jeanne signed the confession of her sins: she acknowledged that she had been wrong to dress like a man and to make war like a man. But, back in prison, she wore pants again in unclear circumstances. For the English, she therefore broke her word and fell back into her errors (she had relapsed). She was condemned to die by flames and was burned alive at Rouen on May 30, 1431.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	912
Before the arrival of Jeanne at Chinon, France was half occupied by the English and their allies. The previous King of France, Charles VI, was mad and had left his wife, the Queen Isabeau de Baviere, alone. Many people thought that Charles VII was not the son of the previous King, but a bastard, an illegitimate son.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	317
The madness of the King caused a great weakness in the kingdom. The princes of the royal family vied for power. The English took the opportunity to invade. The French royal army was annihilated at the battle of Azincourt in 1415. The Queen was forced to sign a treaty, the treaty of Troyes, which stipulated that, on the death of Charles VI, the mad King, the French kingdom would return to the son (Henri VI) of the English King, the grand son of Charles VI and not to the son of Charles VI. But on the death of Charles VI, the son of the King of England was not more than a year old! He was not crowned King therefore, because he was too young. For his part, Charles VII did not have the means to be crowned King, because the coronation city, Reims, was in the middle of enemy controlled territory; and in addition many people thought that he was not the son of the King.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	873
Joans' actions changed everything. The victory at Orleans broke the impression that the English were invincible. The coronation, in the middle of enemy territory, had a great importance: it made it clear to the French population, in the lands occupied by the English, that the true King was Charles, chosen by God, and not the English King. This change in mindset allowed the French to win the war in 1453, twenty years later, the new King now being supported by the people.	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	474
Joan of Arc known as The Maid of Orleans was given a retrial at the request of her mother after her death This second trial established that the first trial was invalid Joan of Arc was made a saint in 1909 Joan has been canonised by the Catholic Church in 1920	5169	Joan_of_Arc	78	260
Climate is the usual temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, and other weather of a specific place. The climate of a place is affected by the latitude, elevation, and distance from an ocean. Climate is different from weather. Weather is the condition of these elements right now or for shorter periods of time such as weeks. People who study climate are called climatologists.	3969	Climate	78	375
The latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the Köppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, (*) which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change.	3969	Climate	78	621
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native. (*) It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. Cheetahs typically reach 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3.6 and 4.9 ft). Adults typically weigh between 20 and 65 kg (44 and 143 lb). Its head is small, rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots.	8817	Cheetah	78	644
The wolf or grey wolf or gray wolf (scientific name : Canis lupus), also known as the timber wolf, is a mammal of the order Carnivora. There are many different wolf subspecies, such as the Arctic Wolf. Some subspecies are listed on the endangered species list, but overall, Canis lupus is IUCN graded as 'least concern'.	4002	Wolf	79	320
Wolves usually measure 70 to 90 cm at the shoulder. Wolves have fur made up of two layers. The top layer is resistant to dirt, and the underlayer is water resistant. The color of their fur can be any combination of grey, white, red, brown, and black. Studies have shown that in 2007 they have found 23 red gray wolfs.	4002	Wolf	79	317
"Wolves live in groups called ""packs"". The members of the pack are usually family members, often just the parents and offspring. Wolves that are not family may join if they do not have a pack of their own. Packs are usually up to 12 wolves, but they can be as small as two or as large as 25. It was long believed that wolf packs were hierarchical, with a couple of alphas. These studies, conducted on wolves in captivity, proved to be wrong for wild wolves and Dr. David Mech, the ""creator"" of the term ""alpha"", retracted his comments. (*)"	4002	Wolf	79	538
Wolves are carnivores and eat mostly medium to large size animals (ungulates), but they will also eat rodents, insectivores and foxes. Some wolves have been seen eating salmon, seals, beached whales, lizards, snakes and birds. They also eat moose, bison, deer and other large animals.	4002	Wolf	79	284
Wolves usually stalk old or sick animals, but they do not always catch what they stalk. They may go days without food. Sometimes only one out of twelve hunts are successful. But the way they eat stays the same. The alpha male and female feed first. Then the other members feed. Sometimes (especially if the prey they have killed is large) wolves may store food and come back that day to feed on it. Wolves have very sharp teeth which helps them tear large chunks of meat from a dead animal. They will eat up to 2/7 their body weight. Wolves will also swallow food and then bring it back up for pups to eat.	4002	Wolf	79	606
Even though many people think that wolves are terrible, mean creatures, they are actually much gentler than many people imagine. The main reason wolves become violent is because they may be sick or to protect other wolves in the pack. Many people around the world, especially in Canada and Alaska, have huskies for pets a close relative of the wolf.	4002	Wolf	79	349
A few years ago wolves were put back into Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to breed, because they were becoming endangered. The wolves have been very successful in the park. There had been no wolves there for a long time, because of hunting and poisoned water. Many people were not happy about this because they were afraid that the wolves would eat the sheep and cows near the park. However, wolves only eat livestock when they can not find wild prey.	4002	Wolf	79	456

"The Welsh language is the Celtic language of Wales that is still spoken throughout the country. Around 21% of the people of Wales (about 600,000 people), as well as some people outside Wales, can speak Welsh. Many people in Wales say they can understand some form of Welsh, such as spoken, written, or can read Welsh, even if they do not speak it all the time. Almost all Welsh people understand and can use the English language. Welsh is a compulsory subject for children in all schools in Wales, and it is taught as a second language in non-Welsh language schools. In Welsh, it is known as Cymraeg, or yr iaith Gymraeg, which means ""the Welsh language"" in Welsh."	4387	Welsh_language	79	664
"Welsh has mutations. Mutations are when a sound (in speech) or a letter (in writing) changes at the start of a word. An example is the Welsh word ""gwneud"", which in English it means ""to do"", and ""dod"", which means ""to come"" ""dewch i mewn"" which means ""come in"". Sometimes the word changes from ""gwneud"" to ""wneud"", and from ""dod"" to ""ddod"". These sounds (in speech) or letters (in writing) changes also occur within, and at the end, of words, although the simplified classification found in ordinary books does not mention this."	4387	Welsh_language	79	528
"In Welsh, there is formal and informal Welsh. Formal Welsh is used when writing, in formal documents, and when speaking to a group (because it also includes the plural), when speaking to someone older than yourself, speaking to someone you have just met, or someone you would like to show respect towards. Formal words and phrases use variations of ""chi"", meaning ""you."" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them ""chi."""	4387	Welsh_language	79	421
"Informal Welsh is used when sending e-mails or sending text messages to your friends or family, and when talking with people you have known for a long time. Informal words and phrases use variations of ""ti"", meaning ""you."" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them ""ti."""	4387	Welsh_language	79	272
"There are some sounds and letters that exist in Welsh but not in English, such as the letters (and sounds) ch and ll. The first sound is pronounced like the Scottish Loch Ness, and an example Welsh word that uses the 'ch' is ""bach"", which means ""small."" Ll is a voiceless 'l,' and is made by placing the tongue on the top of the top gum, and blowing. A Welsh word that uses the 'll' is ""llan"", which means ""church."" Both 'ch' and 'll' are single letters in the Welsh alphabet, along with 'dd,' 'ff,' 'ng,' 'ph,' 'rh,' and 'th.'"	4387	Welsh_language	79	527
"Welsh books and newspapers have been printed for hundreds of years. Some of these books have been translated into English, and some books in other languages have been translated into Welsh. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was translated into Welsh, with the translation of ""Harri Potter a Maen yr Athronydd"", which means the same as the English title."	4387	Welsh_language	79	360
"The Welsh Alphabet has some extra letters that are not used in English, and does not have some others. Although certain letters do not exist in Welsh, they are used sometimes to make sounds that could not possibly be made otherwise. A good example is the word ""garej"" (meaning garage). The letter ""j"" does not exist in the Welsh language, and is a lend-word from English. The traditional word for ""garage"" in Welsh is modurdy, which means, ""motor house"". Another lend-word is ""toiled,"" which means ""toilet"" in English. There are now many lend-words in spoken Welsh. Here is the Welsh alphabet;"	4387	Welsh_language	79	593
1 These letters are vowels. The letter 'W' can be used either as a vowel (when it is said 'oo' like in the Welsh word 'cwm' (coom) meaning 'valley') or as a consonant (when it is said like it is in English, for example in the Welsh word 'gwyn' (gwin) meaning 'white'). This is the same with letter 'I' which can also be used as a consonant (when it is said like an English Y like in 'iogwrt' (yog-oort) meaning yoghurt.	4387	Welsh_language	79	419
2 Letters that are not in the English alphabet, or have different sounds. CH sounds like the 'KH' in Ayatollah KHoumeini. DD is said like the TH in 'There'. F is said like the English 'V'. FF is said like the English 'F'. NG sounds like it would in English but it is tricky because it comes at the beginnings of words (for example 'fy ngardd' - my garden). One trick is to blend it in with the word before it. LL sounds like a cat hissing. PH sounds like the English 'F' too, but it is only used in mutations. RH sounds like an 'R' said very quickly before a 'H'. TH sounds like the 'TH' in 'THin'. W has been explained in the sentences before about vowels.	4387	Welsh_language	79	657
"Velociraptor means ""swift thief"". This is a because it was a small dinosaur that could run fast. Velociraptor was a theropod. The theropods were a group of dinosaurs that walked on two legs. This group of dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds. Velociraptor brains were bigger than most other dinosaurs compared to the size of their bodies. Velociraptor was certainly a smart dinosaur."	4265	Velociraptor	79	383
Velociraptor had feathers on its skin, the same as birds do today. These dinosaurs walked on two legs and had two hands with three fingers and sharp claws. Their heads were long and narrow like a crocodile, and had a mouth with 26 or more teeth which was able to close very quickly. On each foot, they had a large dangerous curved toe claw. Their claws could grow up to 5 inches long. Velociraptor had a stiff tail that it used for balance. The tail could only flex from side to side, not much up and down; this helped the dinosaur run fast and change directions quickly. Velociraptor had two legs which means it was bipedal. Its legs were strong and sturdy and it may have used them to jump. Velociraptors were also very agile.	4265	Velociraptor	79	728
One meal that was definitely on a Velociraptor’s menu was Protoceratops. Protoceratops was a plant-eating dinosaur that was a relative of Triceratops, but had no horns and was the size of a pig. Scientists have found a fossil of Velociraptor locked in a fight with a Protoceratops. The animals killed each other during the fight and a sand dune collapsed on top of them.	4265	Velociraptor	79	370
In a group, Velociraptor could have quickly and quietly circled around an animal that was alone to trap it. Velociraptor hunted by separating a victim from the herd. They killed their prey by piercing its vital organs with their claws or teeth. Velociraptor would stalk up on their prey and pounce on it then it will slash through its prey with its claws	4265	Velociraptor	79	354
Velociraptors lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 80 - 85 million years ago. This was only 15 million years before the dinosaurs became extinct. The world was much hotter than it is today, and there were no polar ice caps. There were small mammals and birds living at the same time as Velociraptor. There were flowering plants and many insects similar to the ones we see today.	4265	Velociraptor	79	388
Velociraptor lived in Asia. Fossils have been found in Russia, China and Mongolia. They lived in a place that was hot and covered by sand dunes. There were streams of water close to where some fossils have been found. They may have lived near the water and preyed on animals that came to drink. Some predators do this today.	4265	Velociraptor	79	324
The first Velociraptor was discovered by Paleontologist Henry Osborn in Mongolia in 1924. A Paleontologist is a scientist that studies dinosaurs. The first fossils found were a skull with jaws and some toes with a claw. The skull was found next to a Protoceratops skull. Paleontologists have found 12 different examples of the animal so far.	4265	Velociraptor	79	341
"In a popular film called Jurassic Park,the Velociraptor did not look like it would have in real life. The movie's Velociraptors were twice as tall as they really were, they were scaly instead of feathered and their tails were too flexible. A real ""Velocoraptor"" was only the size of a Labrador Retriever. The Velociraptors in Jurassic Park look more like a Dromeosaur (Raptor) called Utahraptor, which was Velociraptor's much bigger cousin (which also had feathers). They have appeared in every Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movie since the original in 1993. They did give quill like feathers to the velociraptors in Jurassic Park 3, but revent to the classic design for the Jurassic World Movie in 2015. (*)"	4265	Velociraptor	79	711
Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English actress and model. She is known for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movie series alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. She has played roles in other movies aside from the Harry Potter series, including The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and Ballet Shoes (2007). She became the UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in July 2014. (*)	7034	Emma_Watson	80	402
"As Watson has grown older, she has become more interested in fashion. She says that she thinks fashion is like art, which she studied in school. In September 2008, she told a blogger, ""I've been focusing on art a lot, and fashion's a great extension of that."" (*)"	7034	Emma_Watson	80	263
The Age of Enlightenment was an 18th century cultural movement in Europe. It was most popular in France, where its leaders included philosophers like Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Diderot helped spread the Enlightenment's ideas by writing the Encyclopédie, the first big encyclopedia. The Enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of René Descartes.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	386
The Enlightenment's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves. Because of this, people should not automatically believe what an authority says. People do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say. This was a very new idea at the time.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	291
Another important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it. Even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in. (*) The nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	302
"Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States believed the Enlightenment's ideas. For example, the idea that a government's job is to benefit all of a country's people - not just the people in power - was very important to them. They made this idea about a government ""for the people"" one of the most important parts of the new United States Constitution and the new American government they created."	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	404
"In some countries, kings and queens took some of the Enlightenment's ideas and made changes to their governments. However, they still kept power for themselves. These kings and queens were called ""enlightened despots."" Examples include Catherine II of Russia (Catherine the Great), Frederick II of Prussia, and Gustav III of Sweden."	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	332
"John Locke (1632-1704): An English philosopher known as the Father of Modern Empiricism and the Father of Liberalism. His ideas were very important to Thomas Jefferson and The Founding Fathers when they wrote the United States Declaration of Independence. Locke's ideas about people's rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" were especially important, and appear in the Declaration of Independence."	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	414
Thomas Paine (1737–1809): A writer, Deist, radical republican, and polemicist. He is most famous for writing a pamphlet called Common Sense, which said that England should not be allowed to control the colonies in America. Paine also wrote The Age of Reason, a criticism of the Bible, and The Rights of Man, which defended the French Revolution.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	345
"Voltaire (born François-Marie Arouet) (1694-1778): A philosopher, writer, playwright, and Deist. He argued with the Catholic Church and the French government. Because of this, he was put in prison and exiled from France. He wrote many different books about philosophy, plays, and histories. His ideas were important in the French Revolution. Many people considered the 18th century to be le siècle de Voltaire (the ""Century of Voltaire"")."	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	438
Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): A Swiss-born French philosopher, writer, and teacher. His criticisms of the French State were some of the most powerful of his time. In his book Emile, or On Education, he wrote about many of his opinions on education.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	253
Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826): A statesman, political philosopher, and Deist. He was a Patriot, fighting against England, during the American Revolution. He helped write the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Constitution (1787).	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	264
Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790): A statesman, author, scientist, and poet. He was also a Patriot during the American Revolution and helped write the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Franklin was the first person to understand lightning, and worked as a civil servant in Philadelphia.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	298
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804): A Prussian (German) philosopher, writer, and physicist. He was one of the most important people of the German Enlightenment. Between 1781 and 1790, Kant wrote three important books in the history of philosophy: Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of Judgement.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	319
Adam Smith (1723–1790): An economist and philosopher. He wrote The Wealth of Nations. In this famous book, he argued that wealth was not money; instead, it came from capital and labour. He is sometimes thought to have created the laissez-faire economic theory. His books brought many changes to the Western world.	6976	Age_of_Enlightenment	81	313
A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. (*)	5625	Verb	81	246
Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs.	5625	Verb	81	330
You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be. Also, the past of eat is ate, but the past participle is eaten. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for.	5625	Verb	81	534
English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs.	5625	Verb	81	416
Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens.	5625	Verb	81	286
Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense.	5625	Verb	81	274
Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.)	5625	Verb	81	342
Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.	5625	Verb	81	297
Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., take), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., sleep). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.	5625	Verb	81	409
"Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by very, more, or most. For example, you can say ""That is very interesting,"" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you cannot say ""My teacher is very interesting me in math"" because in this sentence interesting is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb."	5625	Verb	81	601
"Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, ""this drawing is nice"" can change to ""these drawings are nice"", so drawing is a noun. But ""drawing trees is fun"" cannot change to ""drawings trees is fun"", so it is a verb here."	5625	Verb	81	283
"Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot. So, in ""parking the car is hard"", parking is a verb because it takes the object the car. But, if you say, ""there's no parking"", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object."	5625	Verb	81	247
"The Nutcracker is a two-act classical ballet. Marius Petipa wrote the ballet libretto, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed the music. Petipa and Lev Ivanov choreographed the ballet. The Nutcracker is based on Alexandre Dumas' French translation of ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"", an 1816 German fairy tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	332
The Nutcracker was first performed on Sunday 18 December 1892 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, Russia. Twelve year old Stanislava Belinskaya danced the role of Clara while seventeen year old Sergei Legat danced the Nutcracker Prince. Antonietta Dell'Era danced the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy and Pavel Gerdt danced the role of Prince Coqueluche.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	357
The Nutcracker was a modest success; some people liked it, others did not. Most agreed the music was superb. Many years later, the ballet enjoyed even greater success when it was produced in western Europe, Canada, and the United States. Today, The Nutcracker is probably the best known and best loved ballet in the world.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	322
After a brief overture for strings only, the curtain rises on a salon in the home of the Silberhaus family. It is Christmas Eve. The room has been decorated for a Christmas party. The doors are opened. The children rush in to look at the beautiful Christmas tree, and to open their presents.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	291
Suddenly, the Christmas tree grows larger and higher. The room fills with mice. They battle the toys that have come to life. The monstrous Mouse King enters. The Nutcracker leaps from the doll bed. He fights with the Mouse King. When it seems the Mouse King is going to win, Clara throws her slipper at him. It hits the Mouse King, and he hurries away with the other mice. Clara has saved the Nutcracker's life.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	411
Clara and the Nutcracker Prince arrive in the Land of Sweets. They are welcomed by the Sugar Plum Fairy and all her sweet subjects. The Nutcracker tells everyone about his battle with the Mouse King. He tells everyone that Clara saved his life. Everyone thanks Clara.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	267
"The Sugar Plum Fairy orders her subjects to dance for the two children. There are several short dances that include a Spanish dance, a Russian dance, and a dance by Mother Gingerbread and her children. The entertainment ends with the ""Waltz of the Flowers""."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	257
In January 1890, The Sleeping Beauty ballet was performed at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. It was a great success. Tchaikovsky wrote the music for The Sleeping Beauty, and Marius Petipa composed the choreography. Ivan Vsevolojsky, the director of the three Imperial theatres in St Petersburg, believed that another ballet based on a fairy tale with music by Tchaikovsky and choreography by Petipa would have a similar success. He chose Hoffmann's fairy tale for the libretto, and was able to persuade Tchaikovsky and Petipa to join the project.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	554
"fairy tale ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" as the basis for the ballet. This is a very long tale, so much of it had to be discarded for the ballet. It is also very eerie; the French translation by Alexander Dumas (which was nicer than the German original) was chosen as the basis for the ballet libretto."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	308
At first, Tchaikovsky was enthusiastic about the Nutcracker project, but his feelings cooled when he read the libretto. It was made of short episodes and short dances that would not permit him to develop the music on a symphonic scale, as he had done with his two other ballets, Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty. Nevertheless, he set to work on the music, came to enjoy the project in the last stages, and completed the score in August 1892.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	442
"Tchaikovsky brought some unusual instruments to The Nutcracker. These instruments included toy drums, trumpets, tambourines, and bird calls for the party scene in Act I, a choir of women's voices in the orchestra pit for the ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"" at the end of Act I, and a celesta for the ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" in Act II. Petipa had told Tchaikovsky he wanted the music for this dance to sound like water splashing in a fountain."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	444
"Some of the music for The Nutcracker is well known, especially the ""Miniature Overture"", the ""Children's March"", the ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"", the ""Trepak"", ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"", and the ""Waltz of the Flowers"". Perhaps because they were included in the popular Nutcracker Suite."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	290
The music for The Nutcracker is known around the world. Tchaikovsky put some of the best music into a 20-minute concert piece called Nutcracker Suite. This suite was first performed for the St Petersburg Musical Society months before the ballet's debut. It was received to great acclaim.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	287
"The suite consists of the best music from the ballet and includes the Miniature Overture, the Childen's March, the short dances in Act II, and the ""Waltz of the Flowers"". The performance of the suite for the Musical Society was an advertisement for the premiere of the complete ballet in December 1892."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	302
In January 1890, Petipa and Tchaikovsky created the masterpiece of Russian ballet, The Sleeping Beauty. The Nutcracker may have also been a masterpiece if the two men had worked on it together, but during the earliest rehearsals Petipa fell ill and his assistant Lev Ivanov was given the task of choreographing the ballet.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	322
"Ivanov was a shy, unambitious man content with being another's assistant. He was a gifted musician, and more than competent to choreograph The Nutcracker. His masterpiece in The Nutcracker was the ""Waltz of the Snowflakes"". Here, 60 dancers dressed in white with white ornaments on their heads danced in circles, squares, stars, and other geometric shapes to create the effect and feeling of being lost in a snowstorm."	838	The_Nutcracker	83	418
The ballet was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, Russia on Sunday 18 December 1892. Stanislava Belinskaya danced the part of Clara, Antonietta Dell'Era danced the Sugar Plum Fairy, and Pavel Gerdt danced the part of Prince Coqueluche. Riccardo Drigo directed the orchestra. The production was splendid; Tchaikovsky wrote that its splendors wearied his eyes.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	382
The Nutcracker was a Christmas entertainment, and closed at the Mariinsky Theatre in January 1893. It continued to be played in succeeding years, but the ballet was forgotten when the Russian Revolution swept the country in 1917. Russian dancers moved to western Europe to escape the hardships and lack of work in Russia as the Revolution worsened. It was these dancers who revived the ballet to the best of their recollections in western Europe. Excerpts from the ballet were performed now and then, but the first complete Nutcracker was not performed in London until 1934.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	574
Walt Disney and George Balanchine are credited with bringing the ballet to the attention of Americans. Disney used some of the music in his animated movie, Fantasia in the 1940s. Balanchine televised his production of the ballet from New York City in the late 1950s.	838	The_Nutcracker	83	266
She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she was given the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. She helped make modern nursing possible. Nightingale wrote a lot. She lived to be 90 years old.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	352
In her lifetime she was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her books were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor reading skills. She also was an early user of graphs and diagrams to display data.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	258
Nightingale was helped to understand statistics by her country's leading expert on public statistics, William Farr. He was a founder of medical statistics, and epidemiology. Farr worked with her on all the statistics from the Crimean War, which she publicised in her writing. She proved that more men had died from disease than fighting, a very important piece of information. The disease in question was mostly cholera. Cholera is caused by a bacterium which is spread by people drinking water which is contaminated by sewage. Unfortunately, both she and Farr believed the disease was caused by foul air: this was called the miasma theory.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	640
The miasma theory was refuted by John Snow, who discovered the real cause of an outbreak in London. (*) The cause was foul water from a water pump in Broad Street, London. Snow's work was published in 1855, (*) (*) but it was 30 years before the germ theory was generally accepted. Farr publicly acknowledged he was wrong in 1866, (*) but Nightingale never really gave up the miasma idea. London's cholera epidemics stopped once the authorities built sewage treatment plants, delivered cleaner water, and built a system of underground pipes which kept sewage from seeping into the water supply.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	594
Florence Nightingale was born into an upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl. She was a Unitarian. Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother, in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	427
In 1854 when the Crimean War began, Florence was working in Harley Street in London. After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers, she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	262
She knew Sidney Herbert, who was Secretary of War during the Crimean War and he helped her. At the hospital in Istanbul where the injured soldiers were sent, Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war. She was, however, quite wrong about how cholera spread.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	491
"There is a syndrome named after her called ""Florence Nightingale Syndrome"". It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse. While she was working in Crimea she became known as “The Lady with the Lamp” because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers."	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	306
When she returned to England she started a school in 1860 for nurses at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. She wrote her most important book Notes on Nursing. She was a keen Christian but also believed that pagan and eastern religions also contained genuine worth. She was a strong opponent of discrimination against all types of Christians as well as against non-Christians. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work.	7172	Florence_Nightingale	84	466
The Sahara in North Africa, is the one of the largest deserts in the world. The Sahara has about the same size as the whole United States. It has been both larger and smaller at different times. After the last ice age it became more fertile, then dried up again. Most parts are uninhabited, but some people manage to survive in places where there is water.	872	Sahara	84	356
It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlas Mountains, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Sahel region. Inside it are parts of many countries, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, and The Sudan.	872	Sahara	84	251
The highest mountain is 3415 m, and is the Emi Koussi in Chad. Some mountain peaks in the Sahara Desert have snow even in the summer. The main mountain ranges is the Atlas Mountains in Algeria. The Sahara's lowest point lies in the Qattara Depression in Egypt, at about 130 metres below sea level.	872	Sahara	84	297
"An erg (also sand sea or dune sea, or sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover. An erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi) of aeolian or wind-blown sand and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface. Smaller areas are known as ""dune fields""."	872	Sahara	84	380
Metallic minerals are very important to most Saharan countries. Algeria and Mauritania have several major deposits of iron ore. There are also bits of uranium, while Niger has the largest parts of them. A lot of phosphates are in Morocco and Western Sahara. Oil is mainly found in Algeria. The oil is very important to the economy of the entire country. While the mineral exploitation has led to economic growth in Sahara, this has rarely helped the indigenous population, as skilled workers have been brought from other countries.	872	Sahara	84	531
Of the Sahara's around 4 million people, most live in Mauritania, Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt. Dominant groups of people are Sahrawis, Tuareg and Negroids. The largest city is Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. Other important cities are Tamanrasset in Algeria, and Sebha and Ghat in Libya.	872	Sahara	84	302
The soil in Sahara is low in organic matter. The soil in depressions is often saline.Only 200,000 km² of Sahara are fertile oases, where dates, corn, and fruits are grown. The few fertile regions today are fed by underground rivers and underground basins. Many of Sahara's oases rests in depressions (areas under sea level) allowing water to surface from underground reservoirs; artesian wells.	872	Sahara	84	394
Other sorts of vegetation include scattered concentrations of grasses, shrubs and trees in the highlands, as well as in the oases and along river beds. Some plants are well adjusted to the climate, allowing them to germinate within 3 days of rain and sow their seeds within 2 weeks after that.	872	Sahara	84	293
Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 - 8 September 2022) was the Queen of sixteen countries in the world: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. She is the queen of each country separately, and all sixteen are independent countries. She became Queen when her father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	528
The countries of which she was Queen were known as Commonwealth realms. Their total population is over 129 million. Elizabeth II lived in the United Kingdom. In all the other countries where she was queen, a person had been chosen to represent her. This person was known as the Governor General.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	295
Elizabeth II was Queen and was interested in the running of her countries, but she did not tell the governments what to do. She had regular meetings with people from her governments, but it was they who run the countries. She performed ceremonies for the governments, gave out honours, and visited and supports many charities.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	326
From 1947 until 2021, the Queen was married to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip was born into the royal families of Greece and Denmark. Just before they were married, he became a citizen of the United Kingdom, and changed his name to Philip Mountbatten. He became the Duke of Edinburgh on the day he married, and became a Prince of the United Kingdom in 1957. The Queen and Prince Philip have four children, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Their marriage ended with the death of HRH The Duke of Edinburgh on April 9th, 2021.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	557
Elizabeth was 13 years old when World War II started. London was bombed. Elizabeth and Margaret were moved to Windsor Castle. This was for their safety. People thought that they should be sent to Canada. Their mother did not approve this idea.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	243
Princess Elizabeth joined the British army in 1945. She drove a truck. She was a mechanic. In 1947, she made her first official trip outside Britain. She went with her parents to South Africa. She made a speech on her 21st birthday. She said her whole life would be devoted to the service of British Commonwealth and Empire.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	324
"On 8 September 2022, at around noon, Buckigham Palace issued a statement saying that: ""Following further assessment this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended that she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral."""	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	300
Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 20 November 1947. The wedding was held in Westminster Abbey. The couple lived mostly at Clarence House in London. The couple have four children. Charles, Prince of Wales was born 14 November 1948. Their second child is a daughter. She is Anne, Princess Royal. She was born 15 August 1950. The Royal couple had two more sons. Prince Andrew, Duke of York was born 19 February 1960. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex was born 10 March 1964. The princes and princess often use the name Mountbatten-Windsor. This is their official last name. (*)	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	599
In 1951, the King's health was poor. He couldn't go to many public events. Princess Elizabeth started to make official visits for him. The King died on 6 February 1952. (*) Elizabeth was crowned queen on 2 June 1953. The ceremony was held in Westminster Abbey. She wore a dress that was decorated with the national flowers of the countries of the Commonwealth. (*)	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	364
Her early years as Queen were spent traveling to many places. In 1953, the Queen and Prince Philip, began a six-month, around the world tour in the Royal Yacht, Britannia. She was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	248
"In October 1957, she made an official visit to the United States. She spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. She toured Canada. She became the first monarch to open the nation's Parliament. The Queen likes to go to Canada. She calls Canada her ""home away from home""."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	273
There were many more countries that she also ruled, because they belonged to the British Empire. One by one, many of the countries became independent, and as they gained independence she became Queen of many of them. Altogether, she was sovereign of 32 nations.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	261
"Some of the countries are now republics and have a president as ""Head of State"", while some of them keep the Queen as ""Head of State"". Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch of more than one independent nation. The old British Empire became the Commonwealth of Nations."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	269
"Ever since she became the Queen, Elizabeth has spent about three hours every day ""doing the boxes"". The ""boxes"" are two large red boxes that are brought to her from the Parliament every day. They are full of state papers sent to her from her various departments, embassies, and government offices. (*) One of the most famous photos taken of Elizabeth as a teenager shows her with her father, the King, learning about ""the boxes"". Because she has been doing this since 1952, she knows a great deal about the government of the UK."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	528
When the Queen is in London, she meets her Prime Minister once a week, to talk about events. She also has meetings with the First Minister of Scotland and other Ministers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Ministers and Ministers of other countries, when she is in their country, or when they visit London.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	326
"In the late 1990s, there were ""referendums"" in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom. This was called a ""devolution policy"". As a result, the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales, were set up. The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	371
Recently, some people in Australia want a republic, with an elected or appointed President as Head of State instead of the Queen. In 1999, the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic. The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy. The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	405
"Elizabeth II is friends with many world leaders. Her first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies called her ""My Dear"" and recited a poem that said ""I will love her till I die"". She has friendships with Mary Robinson, President of Ireland (1990-1997) and George W. Bush, who was the first American President in more than 80 years to stay at Buckingham Palace. Nelson Mandela, in the BBC documentary, called her ""my friend, Elizabeth""."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	443
"Elizabeth II, as the Monarch of the United Kingdom, is the ""Supreme Governor"" of the Church of England and sworn protector of the Church of Scotland. She is very interested in the Church of England, but the Archbishop of Canterbury runs the church. She rarely attends the yearly meeting of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	337
The Queen regularly goes to church wherever she is: at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham House, Crathie Kirk at Balmoral Castle, and Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, when she stays there in Holyroodhouse, her official home in Scotland.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	277
"The Queen often meets with leaders from other religions as well. In 1980, she became the first British Monarch to visit the Vatican, where she was welcomed by Pope John Paul II. She made another visit twenty years later on October 17, 2000. (*) Queen Elizabeth II is Patron of ""The Council of Christians and Jews"" in the UK."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	324
"The Queen has shown a very strong sense of duty, ever since she was a girl. Her father, King George VI, was not meant to be king. Her uncle became king when her grandfather died. But he fell in love with an American woman who was divorced, and that wasn't allowed. So he had to give up being king very shortly after ascending. George VI didn't want to be king, because he was quite nervous and had a stammer. However, Elizabeth's grandfather said that he didn't think her uncle was very good as a king, and wanted George to reign, then Elizabeth. From the moment she realised that one day she would be Queen, she became very interested in her duties and did all she could to help her father. Her promise to serve her people all her life has always been very important to her. Some people think that now that she is old, perhaps she will retire (""abdicate"") and let her son Prince Charles take over. People who know her well, including Prince Charles, have said that this will never happen."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	989
"The Queen has often shown courage, ever since she joined the military at 18. During a trip to Ghana in 1961, she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to kill him. But she refused to stay away. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like ""a film star""."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	408
In 1964, when the Queen was invited to Quebec, there were fears for her safety because there was opposition to her visit. There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled. But the Queen's secretary said that the Queen would not want to be stopped from going to Quebec because of any danger. During the Trooping the Colour in 1981, she was shot at, but she carried on. It was later discovered that the shots were blanks. In 1982, a man called Michael Fagan broke into Buckingham Palace in the morning, and found the Queen's bedroom. He woke her up, and sat on her bed, until the guards came to take him away.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	615
"Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her duties by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip promised to help the Queen on the day of her Coronation. The Queen was also helped by her mother Queen Elizabeth, known as ""The Queen Mother"", who lived to be 101 years old, and stayed very active in her old-age. The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities. She has many invitations and official duties. Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family, who have also become patrons of many organisations."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	588
The Queen was sad about the broken marriages and divorces of three of her children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. Prince Charles's marriage to Lady Diana Spencer was thought to be a fairytale wedding because she was young and beautiful. But it soon became unhappy, and after their divorce, she was killed in a car accident in 1997. On 9 April 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he had loved for many years. In the year 2002, within a few months of each other, the Queen's mother and sister, Princess Margaret, both died.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	561
The Queen's wealth is private. It is difficult to estimate how much she is worth. She owns Sandringham House, Balmoral Castle, and other large properties. She does not own Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, or the royal collection of art. These are worth millions of pounds. In 2010, Forbes magazine estimated her personal fortune at about US$450 million (£300 million). (*)	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	374
In 1977, the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee. This jubilee marked the 25th anniversary of her coming to the Throne. There was a royal procession in the golden State Coach. A service of thanksgiving was held at St. Paul's Cathedral. Millions of people watched on television. There were parties across the UK. Five commemorative stamps were printed. The Jubilee line of the London Underground opened in 1979. It was named in honour of the anniversary.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	453
In 2002, Elizabeth II celebrated her Golden Jubilee. This jubilee marked the 50th anniversary of her coming to the Throne. She toured the Commonwealth countries. There was a pop concert in the gardens of Buckingham Palace. A service of thanksgiving was held at St. Paul's Cathedral.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	282
The Queen and Prince Philip celebrated their sixtieth (Diamond) wedding anniversary on 19 November 2007, with a special service at Westminster Abbey. The night before, Prince Charles gave a private dinner party at Clarence House for twenty members of the Royal Family.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	268
On the following day, 20 November, the Queen and Prince Philip went on a visit to Malta, where they had stayed from 1949 to 1951 after getting married. A Royal Navy ship which was nearby, got its sailors to line up on deck, to form a big number '60', for the couple's sixtieth wedding anniversary.	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	297
"When someone is talking about the Queen, she is called ""The Queen"" or ""Her Majesty"". When someone is talking to her, she is called ""Your Majesty"". After the first time, the person talking to the Queen can say ""Ma'am"". It is pronounced ""Mam"". These are the titles that she has had:"	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	280
"The Queen has several coats of arms. In the UK, they are known as the ""Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom"". Every British monarch has used these arms since the reign of Queen Victoria. The coats of arms used in Scotland and Canada are different to the arms used in England and Wales."	4549	Elizabeth_II	85	289
French (Français) is a language spoken in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and several countries of Northern Africa (Tunisia, Gabon, etc.) and Western Africa (for example, Uganda), in the Caribbean (places like Martinique) and elsewhere. It is also the official language of the Canadian province of Quebec and one of the official languages of New Brunswick. French is a Latin language like Spanish and Italian.	6219	French_language	85	419
"French uses the Latin alphabet just as English does, with the addition of several accent marks that are not used in English: the acute accent or accent aigu (é), the grave accent or accent grave (è), and the circumflex accent or accent circonflexe (ê). There is also a diacritical mark called a cedilla or cédille, which is placed under the letter c (ç) to give it a soft pronunciation (like an ""s"" sound) in certain situations where it would otherwise be pronounced hard (like a ""k"")."	6219	French_language	85	485
There are 110 million people who can speak French natively. But there are 300 million French speakers total, which means that 190 million people decided to learn the language as adults! This is because there is a lot of interesting literature in French. French is also a language often used in diplomacy.	6219	French_language	85	304
French was first spoken in France. Four of France's neighbors — Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Monaco — also use French as one of their official languages. And because of colonization, French is spoken in Canada (the majority in Québec), Louisiana, some countries in Africa, and other places around the world.	6219	French_language	85	316
French evolved from the Latin language, just like Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian. In the 1600s, French people came to Canada and settled in the area we now call Québec. Some French people (who were expelled from Canada) also settled in Louisiana, which was named in honor of King Louis XIV of France. Louisiana is now a state of the United States. In the 1800s, France conquered large parts of northern, western, and central Africa. As France took over ruling these territories and their populations, they established French as the language of instruction in schools, and as the official language of the government. Over time, French became the second native language of many African people, although local languages are still used most often in the home. Although France no longer rules these former colonies, they still use French in daily life.	6219	French_language	85	859
The piano (or pianoforte to give it its proper name) is a musical instrument with a keyboard. A normal piano has 88 keys. Pianos use the keys to move hammers that hit strings inside, making a sound. Pianos come in two basic shapes: grand pianos and upright pianos. The piano has been an extremely popular instrument in Western classical music since the late 18th century. A person who plays the piano is called a pianist.	5695	Piano	87	421
The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua, Italy. He made his first piano in 1709. It developed from the clavichord which looks like a piano but the strings of a clavichord are hit by a small blade of metal called a “tangent” (*) . In the piano the strings are hit by a hammer. The early keyboarded instruments, such as the clavichords, harpsichords and organs that were used at that time, had a much shorter keyboard than they do today. Gradually the keyboard became longer until it had the 88 notes (7 octaves plus three notes) of the modern piano.	5695	Piano	87	565
At first the instrument was called the “fortepiano”. This means “loud-soft” in Italian. It was given this name because it could be played either loudly or softly, depending on how hard the note was hit (the harpsichord could not do this, and the clavichord could only make a tiny difference between louder and softer). Later this name changed to “pianoforte”. This is normally shortened to “piano”. The word “fortepiano” is sometimes used to describe the pianos of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In some languages, such as Russian, “fortepiano” is the normal word for a piano.	5695	Piano	87	585
Although the piano was invented at the beginning of the 18th century, it was not until 50 years later that it started to become popular. The first time the piano was played in a public concert in London was in 1768 when it was played by Johann Christian Bach (*) . The upright piano was invented in 1800 by John Isaac Hawkings. Seven years later T. Southwell invented “overstringing”. This means that the strings for the low notes go diagonally across the soundboard so that they can be longer and make a much bigger sound.	5695	Piano	87	523
The early pianos had strings that were fastened to a frame made of wood. They were not very heavy, but they were not very strong or loud, so they could not be heard very well in a big concert hall. In 1825 the cast-iron frame was invented in America. This made the piano much stronger so that it could make a bigger sound and the strings were not likely to break.	5695	Piano	87	363
A piano has a keyboard with white keys and black keys. When a key is pressed down, the damper comes off the string and a hammer hits the string. It hits it very quickly and bounces off so that the string is free to vibrate and make a sound. When the player takes his finger off the key the damper falls back onto the string and the sound stops. The strings are stretched very tightly across the frame, passing over a bridge on the way. The bridge touches the soundboard. This means that the vibrations are sent to the soundboard. The soundboard is a very important part of the piano. If it is damaged the piano will not make a good sound.	5695	Piano	87	638
The mechanism which makes the hammer bounce off the string very quickly is called the “escapement”. In 1821 Sebastian Erard invented a kind of double escapement. This made it possible to repeat the note very quickly. The hammer only touches the string for about one thousandth of a second. The hammers are covered with felt which is a mixture of wool, silk and hair.	5695	Piano	87	366
The damper pedal - this pedal is on the right. When a pianist presses it down with his right foot, any notes he plays will keep on sounding even when he takes his finger(s) off the note(s). This is because there are dampers (they look a bit like the hammers) that rest on all the strings. When the pianist holds the right pedal down all the dampers come off the strings so that the strings are free to vibrate. When a note is played, that note will continue to sound. Some other strings will also vibrate very lightly (this is called “sympathetic vibration”). It will make the sound smoother and richer. Pianists have to learn how to use the pedal well. This will depend on such things as the style of the music, the size of the piano, the size of the room and whether there is a lot of furnishing there.	5695	Piano	87	804
The soft pedal - the soft pedal is on the left. When a pianist presses it down with his left foot, the notes sound quieter. On a grand piano the whole keyboard and action shift a bit to the left so that the hammers only hit two strings instead of three. Also the parts of the felt which hit the string are softer because they have not become hard with lots of use. The soft pedal is normally kept down for the whole of a piece or the whole of a section of a piece. This pedal is sometimes called the una corda pedal. Una corda means: one string. This is because in the early pianos it was possible to press the pedal a little way so that the hammers hit two strings, then press it further so that they hit only one string. This is why the sign to tell a pianist to use the left pedal is “una corda”. To cancel the left pedal the composer writes “tre corde” (“three strings”) in the music.	5695	Piano	87	888
The middle pedal is called the sostenuto pedal. Like the right pedal, it keeps the sound going, but it only affects notes that are already being played at the moment when the middle pedal is pressed down. This makes it possible to keep one chord going while playing other notes that will not carry on. All concert grand pianos have a sostenuto pedal, and some modern upright pianos do as well. Some upright pianos have a middle pedal that is not a sostenuto pedal at all, but a practice pedal. It makes the sound very quiet indeed so that a pianist can practise without disturbing other people. The practice pedal can usually be pressed down and put in a slot so that it will stay in place.	5695	Piano	87	690
Once the piano became popular in the late 18th century many composers wrote music for the piano. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart started to learn on harpsichords when he was very small, but the piano was becoming popular when he was a young man and he wrote many sonatas and concertos for the piano. Franz Joseph Haydn also wrote a lot of piano music. Ludwig van Beethoven was a very famous pianist before he became very famous as a composer. His piano compositions include 5 concertos and 32 sonatas. In the Romantic period many composers wrote for the piano. They include Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt and Frédéric Chopin. Later composers include Sergei Rachmaninoff, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich and Bela Bartok.	5695	Piano	87	779
Some famous piano players from the early days of the piano include Dussek, Mozart, Clementi, John Field and Chopin. In the 19th century Franz Liszt was a very great influence on the piano by composing and performing very difficult music. Other great pianists include Clara Schumann and Anton Rubinstein. 20th century pianists include Artur Schnabel, Vladimir Horowitz, Josef Hofmann, Wilhelm Kempff, Dinu Lipati, Claudio Arrau, Artur Rubinstein, Sviatoslav Richter, Alfred Brendel. Among the greatest pianists today are Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, Leif Ove Andsnes, Boris Berezovsky and Evgeny Kissin.	5695	Piano	87	611
Pianists who play popular music include Liberace, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jimmy Swaggart, Little Richard, Elton John, Billy Joel, Thelonious Monk, Tori Amos and Ray Charles. Perhaps the greatest jazz pianist was Fats Waller. Probably the best known is the musical genius, Joey Drost.	5695	Piano	87	276
The piano has been a very popular instrument ever since the mid 18th century when it soon replaced the clavichord and the harpsichord. By the early 19th century the sound that the piano made was big enough to fill large concert halls. Smaller pianos were made for use in people’s homes. At first these included square pianos and giraffe pianos, later on the upright pianos became popular for home use. Pianos are not often used in orchestras (if they are, they are part of the percussion section). They may, however, be used for piano concertos (pieces for solo pianist accompanied by orchestra). There is a vast amount of music written for piano solo. The piano can also be used together with other instruments, in jazz groups, and for accompanying singing.	5695	Piano	87	758
Pianists have to learn many things. It is important to sit comfortably with a straight back so that hands can reach all the keys. The hands should be shaped like a ball so that the fingers are curved. They should be able to control the sound they make with the weight of the arm and fingers. Lots of practice is needed to become a good pianist. Some people can play the piano very well “by ear”, but learning to read music helps a person to become a better pianist and musician. Playing the piano helps people to understand harmony because the piano can play chords.	5695	Piano	87	566
Catherine II empress of Russia is not Russian by birth: the small Sophie-Frederique of Anhalt-Zerbst was a part of the German nobility. She was born in the village of Stettin in 1729, in the kingdom of Prussia. Her parents were disappointed because they were hoping for a son.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	276
Sophie-Frédérique was educated in a rigid and austere manner. Her parents being Protestants, she received a religious education different from Russians. She was not a very happy child. Her only ray of sunshine was her governess, who taught her French through the great writers.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	277
In Russia the kingdom was at its peak and the tsarina Elizabeth of Russia begins to think about an heir. Her decision seems to have a vital importance because it could lead to diplomatic and civil unrest. One thinks particularly of Peter Fiodorovitch, his nephew. Determined to not give into representatives of the noble families, Elizabeth maintains her initial judgement and nominates Peter future tsar of Russia. After the dilemma of the nomination of her heir, Elizabeth will have to choose a wife for Pierre.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	513
Very soon, the many candidates arrive, all wanting to be the future tsarina of Russia. Catherine was then presented within the course of the high German nobility, and it was in these networks that Elisabeth met the emissaries. Sophie comes to be advised: Elisabeth is interested in the young princess, because formerly she had been betrothed to Sophie's uncle before he died; that is why at the moment of finding a spouse for Pierre, she remembers the family of Anhalt-Zerbst. Sophie's mother seizes the opportunity and sends portraits of her daughter, representing her at her most charming. Finally, Elizabeth accepts: Sophie is seductive, born of a German nobility (an allied country during this period), and she is ignorant in political matters. Sophie's mother therefore finds herself proposing an invitation for her daughter to Saint Petersburg.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	850
In 1744, Sophie, 15 years old, arrived in Russia. Her marriage with Pierre is celebrated on June 28 in Saint-Petersburg. But the young wife does not lead a happy life: the aunt queen, jealous, has Sophie spied upon, and the duke Peter is a mean, stupid, drunk and rude husband. But Catherine does not ignore what is at stake: she has hope that one day, she can govern Russia. So she is patient. Accepting her sad fate, she devotes herself to a variety of past-times: she observes the functioning of the State, learns Russian, changes here name to the more Russian name of Catherine Alexeivna, and converts to the orthodox religion on June 28, 1744.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	648
Desperate in the face of such a family, Catherine seeks support from the Army, the arts and the State. She finds help, for example, from the ambassador of Saxony Stanislas Poniatowski, the minister of Peter III Nikita Panin, or military leaders such as Prince Orlov. Catherine was beginning to no longer feel alone but the death of Elizabeth at the beginning of the year 1762 accelerates things. Peter succeeds her under the name of Peter III, but he remains just as drunk and crazy. He proves to be brutal towards his wife, insulting her in public and locking her up in the Peterhof Palace, on the banks of the Gulf of Finland.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	628
Catherine put underway a plan aimed at overthrowing the throne of her violent husband. She went to ask for aid from the Orlov brothers and from England. In June, 1762, she returns to Saint Petersburg where the armies were waiting for her. In front of 14,000 men, she was proclaimed empress in the absence her husband. Peter III understood that he had been betrayed, but he had no support, and Catherine forced him to abdicate. A month later, Peter III is found dead in his room. Murder, suicide? Several hypotheses were put forward, but there was strong suspicion that it was Grigori Orlov who killed him. Catherine found herself the sole sovereign of the greatest empire in Europe.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	682
To strengthen her throne, Catherine had herself crowned in Moscow at the cathedral of the Dormition, in the heart of the Kremlin, the palace of the tsars, in September 1762. She becomes Catherine II of Russia. One morning, they say, she woke up and summoned her doctors, ordering them to bleed her so that henceforth she would have only Russian blood.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	351
Peter III's minister, Nikita Panin, is installed as leader of Poland. But, when it became apparent that the contract he had previously signed establishing that Russia was allied with certain countries in northern Europe, would not hold up for long, he was replaced by the ambassador Stanislas Auguste Poniatowski, who was sent to govern the country for more security. Catherine also made Russia an oriental power, notably through wars against the Ottoman Empire, and against numerous powers who held territories on the Black Sea. She also won Crimea, the fortresses of Azov, Taganrog, Kinburn and Izmail, and launched a war against Sweden.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	639
However these reforms barely affected the countryside. Also Catherine should face a huge revolt led by Pougatchev. She finally ends the rebellion by imprisoning and by executing this rebel. Catherine refused to condemn the other rebels, but refused to abolish serfdom.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	268
Catherine hates the French revolutionaries, democracy, republic because this set up a wide anarchy in poorly monitored regions of Russia. When the French Revolution broke out, Catherine was 60 years old. She seemed lonely and sad. All support is dead and her son Paul I of Russia hate and accusing her of having killed his father. Catherine responds in kind, seeing in him nothing but an incompetent and a degenerate.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	417
In the morning of November 17, 1796, Catherine collapsed. The tsaritsa passed away after reigning over Russia for more than 30 years. For her succession, she had everything predicted. In her will, she disinherited Paul and passed on the power directly to her grandson Alexandre. But Paul discovers the will and burns it. Then he made open the tomb of his father Pierre III, crowned him and settled his mother nearby. So Catherine rests in the cathedral Peter and Paul of Saint-Petersburg, near this husband whom she always hated.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	529
The czarina is not only famous for her military victories, but also for her culture. Alone in her childhood, she read all the French novels she came across. Finally, she asserted her preference for the historic books, and later, she created the academy of Three noble arts.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	273
She made friends with Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire, and asked them for advice on society and invited them to Russia. The subject she tackled the most often during her long interviews with the French philosophers was that of education, a major problem in Russia, which was considerably behind in this regard. So pushed by Enlightenment ideas that it reforms the country. It is also confirms their sympathy and love for culture by buying libraries philosophical. Diderot attempted to convince Catherine to create a Parliament, but the tzarina vehemently refused.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	564
Do not misunderstand: if Catherine admires the Philosophers, it does not take sides for a republic. She practices censorship and shows frightened by the French revolution. However, at the time, almost all of the population of the Russian Empire remains illiterate and this does not depend on one person even a queen. It still under her education of young Russians (the affluent few) wins the most.	6188	Catherine_II_of_Russia	88	397
The Moon can be seen from Earth. The Moon is actually very large, about a quarter the size of the Earth, but because it is far away it looks quite small. The gravity on the Moon is one-sixth of the Earth's gravity. It means that a person would be 6 times lighter on the Moon than on Earth. The moon is a rocky and dusty place.	1002	Moon	88	326
But even though the Moon's gravity is weaker than the Earth's gravity, it is still there. If a person threw a ball while standing on the Moon, it would still fall back down. However, it would fall much more slowly. A person who jumped as high as possible on the Moon would jump higher than on Earth but still fall back to the ground. That person could also fall badly on the Moon and not be hurt at all, because the moon's gravity would not pull as hard as the Earth's gravity does.	1002	Moon	88	482
The Moon has no atmosphere. Without an atmosphere, people are not protected from heat or cold. Because of this, astronauts have to wear very heavy spacesuits for protection and to carry oxygen to breathe. Of course, since the Moon does not have a lot of gravity, the spacesuit would not be as heavy as it would be on Earth.	1002	Moon	88	323
In the Earth, the sky is blue because the blue frequency of the Sun's light rays bounce off the gases in the atmosphere, making it look like the sky is blue. But on the Moon, because there is no atmosphere, the sky looks black, even in the daytime.	1002	Moon	88	248
The Moon appears lit up as it goes around (orbits) the Earth. The Moon gives out no light—we can only see the parts that are reflecting light from the Sun. This means sometimes we can see the whole Moon and other times only parts of it. These different stages are called lunar phases. It takes the Moon about 29.53 days (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes) to complete the cycle, from big and bright to small and dim and back to big and bright.	1002	Moon	88	439
"As the Moon passes between the Earth and Sun, this phase is called the ""new moon"". The next phase of the moon is called the waxing crescent, followed by the first quarter, waxing gibbous, then to a full moon, appearing as a complete circle. A full moon occurs when the Moon is opposite the Earth, the farthest away from the Sun. As the Moon continues its orbit is become a waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent, and finally back to a new moon."	1002	Moon	88	452
Before people stood on the Moon, some of the big countries in the world, the United States and Russia (which used to be part of the USSR) sent robots to the Moon. These robots would fly around, crawl, or in the case of Luna 2, crash into the Moon. The robots were the first things that humans made that touched the Moon.	1002	Moon	88	320
Humans finally landed on the Moon on 21 July 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, landed their space probe (the Eagle) on the surface of the Moon. Then, as half the world watched him on television, Armstrong climbed down the ladder of the Eagle and was the first to touch the Moon. Later, Buzz Aldrin hops out of the Eagle, and together, they put the American flag near the spot where they landed. They explored around collecting rocks for about an hour before leaving.	1002	Moon	88	478
Environment is the sum total of what is around something or someone. (*) It includes living things and natural forces. The environment of living things provides conditions for development and growth, as well as of danger and damage. Living things do not simply exist in their environment. They constantly interact with it. Organisms change in response to conditions in their environment. The environment consists of the interactions among plants, animals, soil, water, temperature, light, and other living and non-living things.	4487	Environment	89	528
The word environment is used to talk about many things. People in different fields of knowledge (like history, geography or biology) use the word differently. An electromagnetic environment is the various radio waves that equipment such as radio and radar can meet. Galactic environment refers to conditions between the stars. (*)	4487	Environment	89	330
Environment is rarely fully natural. Nearly all environments have been directly or indirectly influenced by humans at some point in time. Thus many landscape or forest are the product of the interaction between nature and humans.Yet they host real ecosystem.	4487	Environment	89	258
Some people call themselves environmentalists. These people think that harmony with the environment is important and should be taken more seriously. They think we must protect the environment (to keep it safe.) They think people should not put so much pollution (waste) into the environment. The important things in the environment that we value are called natural resources. For example, fish, water, energy, and forests. Some are renewable natural resources because more grow naturally when we use them. Some are non-renewable natural resources that do not come back naturally, for example coal and natural gas.	4487	Environment	89	613
In psychology and medicine a person's environment is the people, physical things, places, and events that the person lives with. The environment affects the growth and development of the person. It affects the person's behavior. It affects the person's body, mind and heart.	4487	Environment	89	274
Environment is also the culture that a person lived in. A person's beliefs and actions are dependent on his environment. For example, Thomas Jefferson and Julius Caesar owned slaves. Modern people mostly think it's wrong to own slaves. But in Jefferson's and Caesar's different environments slavery was normal. So, their actions did not look as wrong in their societies.	4487	Environment	89	370
The Earth is our planet. At the moment, it's the only planet with life because it has a dense atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen. The predominant color is the blue because it is three-quarters covered by oceans. It is believed to have formed about 4,600 million years ago.	519	Earth	89	271
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is orbiting between Venus and Mars at an average distance of 149.6 millions km. The Earth also has one satellite, which is the Moon and has an equatorial diameter of 12,756 km across it.	519	Earth	89	253
"Christianity is a religion based on two main things: First: The belief and following of the Judeo-Christian God, and of the Holy Bible. (Often called by Christians ""The One and Only True God."") And Second: the purpose and prophetic fulfillment of Jesus Christ (""The Lamb of God."") There are nearly two-and-a-half billion people across the world who follow Christianity. (*) They call themselves Christians which means 'followers of Christ.'"	5663	Christianity	94	440
"God reveals his word, plan, and purpose through his Holy Spirit, when reading a series of many ancient books wrapped into one large book called the Holy Bible, (also called ""The perfect inspired Word of God."") which He inspired certain humans to write over the course of recorded human history, and that aims to teach certain special knowledge, which might develop into wisdom. Much of which tells about God's relationship with his Creation and the interaction with humanity from the beginning of the world to shortly after the life of Jesus, and as well as the Future and the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" to yet to come."	5663	Christianity	94	612
There is only one True God, but he includes three divine 'persons' in one, called the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or sometimes 'Holy Ghost'). These three 'persons' share the same essence, purpose, and mind which makes them the same being. Within the Trinity, each of the three Persons can act separately from each other Person yet together they are in perfect unity.	5663	Christianity	94	382
"This sin caused a fundamental incompatibility, or estrangement, between humanity and God, and caused Adam and Eve to be sent away from their perfect paradise home known as 'The Garden of Eden.' (Of what some Christians believe could have been located in the center of the original super-continent of Pangea, of what now is the ""Promised Land of Israel."") and suffer a cursed life of increased separation and distancing from God. Because God is Perfect and Good and cannot co-exist with eternal evil; only temporal evil.) Some Churches call this the ""original sin""."	5663	Christianity	94	564
'God The Son' took human form as a man, son of a Hebrew woman named Mary, and now exists as both God and man. This is called the Incarnation, where God was manifested in the flesh. It could be thought of as: Jesus is God's character or avatar which he controlled and played until 'Game Over,' but his game over was actually the secret to unlocking the secret ending, because his character had another life.	5663	Christianity	94	406
Jesus lived a perfect life without sin, and taught his followers many things about right and wrong, and also performed miracles like healing certain people who were blind, deaf, or sick in other ways. He even raised people back from the dead to perfect health.	5663	Christianity	94	260
By being a perfect and sinless sacrifice, Jesus reconciled humanity with God, by personally paying the cost of our evil and wickedness, and broke the power of 'second-death' over humanity. The second death is a dimension of justice called Hell.	5663	Christianity	94	244
"Jesus taught his followers for a few more weeks then left for Heaven. He left into the dimension called Heaven to ""Prepare a place for you."" It could be thought of it as: The upgrade server for the really fun, cool new game is busy loading, but when the time is just right he's coming back for us."	5663	Christianity	94	297
People who have accepted God's free gift of salvation into their hearts, and thus are in a good relationship with God, and have been compassionate to others as a result, will live in a perfect form with God and Jesus in Heaven forever and ever after they die or are raptured and translated.	5663	Christianity	94	290
"Alpha and Omega - The Greek letters Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. Sometimes the Alpha and Omega are written next to each other, and sometimes the Omega is written over the Alpha. Alpha and Omega is a reference to Jesus, who calls himself ""Alpha and Omega"" (First and Last) in the Revelation."	5663	Christianity	94	331
Cross - The cross is the most common symbol of Christianity. Christians believe that their saviour Jesus Christ was crucified by the Romans. The cross is important because Jesus died as a sacrifice for the sins of believers. It represents God's love for humanity.	5663	Christianity	94	263
(Note on crosses and crucifixes) Christians express different feelings to crucifixes and crosses, and can have a preferred way of remembering that moment in time. Some like to think of him still on the cross (reminding us what the price for our sin was), and some like to see an empty cross to remember that Jesus' mission is complete and that he is now in heaven preparing it for Christians.	5663	Christianity	94	392
"INRI - INRI is an acronym in Latin meaning ""Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."" This is the message that was put on the cross as being the crime for which he was being punished (sedition). Christians now use it as a symbol of Jesus' messiahship."	5663	Christianity	94	247
Interlocking Rings - The interlocking rings are a symbol of the Trinity. Each ring is a complete circle, which represents each complete person of the Trinity. But each ring is locked with the other two rings, showing that they cannot be separated from the Trinity.	5663	Christianity	94	264
Christians are classified by denomination, which are split resulting from arguments over doctrine. The first split was in the 5th century after the Church Council of Chalcedon. The dispute was over the personhood of Jesus. Should he be regarded as one person with two natures, or as two persons? The philosophically technical nature of the discussion and the lack of professional translators caused the split. The Christians who did not agree with the decision of the Council to excommunicate them, became the Non-Chalcedonian Orthodox. The largest Non-Chalcedonian Churches are the Coptic Orthodox in Egypt, the Ethiopian Orthodox, the Armenian, and some Lebanese Orthodox Churches. Recent discussions between the Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II and the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III concluded that they believe many of the same things after all, even though the Coptic Church does not recognise the Pope as its leader.	5663	Christianity	94	925
The second split happened in the 11th century. It is called the Great Schism. It was mostly based on personality conflicts between the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople, fuelled by cross-cultural miscommunications and some really bad behaviour on the part of the Crusaders from Western Europe. The Christians in Western Europe were led by the Bishop of Rome, known also as the Pope, and are called the Roman Catholic Church. Most Christians in Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Middle East belong to the Orthodox Churches, led by the Bishops of other cities or areas.	5663	Christianity	94	566
In the 15th century the invention of the printing press made it easier for more people to read and study the Bible . This led many thinkers over the years to develop new ideas and to break away from the Pope to start the Protestant Reformed churches. Some Catholics and Orthodox do not consider Protestants to be fully Christian. The most important of these thinkers were Martin Luther and John Calvin. Later, disagreements caused these denominations to split again into smaller groups. The main Protestant denominations today are the Baptist, Lutheran, and Calvinist Presbyterian Churches. In England, a similar protest against the Pope, first political and later religious, led to the Church of England who call themselves Protestant, but are sometimes felt to be Reformed Catholic because they have bishops. Within the Anglican Churches can be found groups ranging from more Protestant to more Catholic in their style of service.	5663	Christianity	94	932
In general, the Protestant denominations differ from the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches in having given up some of the traditional sacraments, no ordained priesthood, and not having the same fondness for Mary, the mother of Jesus, that the Catholic and Orthodox churches have. The main worship service in Catholic Churches is the Mass and the main worship service in many Orthodox Churches is called the Divine Liturgy. Both services involve a ceremony with a priest where Jesus changes a small amount of bread and wine into his real body and blood, but without changing the accidents (appearance, taste, colour, etc.) of the bread and wine. Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of their Saviour, Jesus. Catholics in particular have developed a short ceremony worshipping Jesus present in the Eucharist. This ceremony is known as Eucharistic Benediction. Some Protestant churches have ceremonies more or less similar to the Mass, but believe the bread and wine are symbolic only. Protestants also differ from Catholic and Orthodox Christians in placing more emphasis on the individual's personal conversion experience. Catholic and Orthodox Christians place the emphasis on the ongoing growth in holiness that should take place over the person's lifetime. Roman Catholic Christian spirituality often involves the use of statues and other artistic representations, candles, incense, and other physical items as reminders or aids to prayer. The Orthodox Churches also use candles, incense, and bells, and icons but there are never statues in an Orthodox Church. Orthodox Churches have a particularly well-developed spiritual-beauty connection. Orthodox and Catholic worship also involves use of gestures, such as the Sign of the Cross. The Roman Catholic sign of the cross is made by touching in sequence your forehead, chest, one shoulder, then the other shoulder. There is also bowing, kneeling, and prostration involved in Catholic and Orthodox worship. Protestants have traditionally viewed these as a temptation to idolatry, and have not incorporated as much artwork into their prayer life.	5663	Christianity	94	2158
The Rhine is an important waterway. Many goods are transported over the Rhine, and the Rhine valley is also an important wine producing region. The river Rhine begins at Tomasee, a lake in the canton of Graubünden in Switzerland, (*) and runs through Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. It is also the border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein and also the border between Germany and France. It runs through Basel, Bonn, Cologne and Duisburg. It also separates the cities of Mainz and Wiesbaden.	516	Rhine	94	504
It was a quiet river, until the Industrial Revolution hit Europe, and factories set up along its banks and emptied all their waste into the River. The Salmon left and every living thing died. Then after World War II, the Rhine Action Programme was set up to boost the Rhine's wildlife and reduce the pollution there.	516	Rhine	94	316
"German uses the Latin alphabet just like English, French, and Spanish, with one extra (non-Latin) letter, the eszett and umlauts, which are not used in English. Eszett is pronounced ""ss"". It is only found in the German alphabet, and looks like this: ß. Umlauts are dots which can be placed above three of the vowels in German, and which change the sound of them. They look like this: Ä, ä, Ö, ö, Ü, ü."	6993	German_language	98	401
"West Germanic was an ancient language that evolved into many different languages including German, English, Frisian, Low German and Dutch. German evolved from West Germanic between 400AD and 1200AD when people in southern and middle regions of Germany started pronouncing several consonants differently. This language is now called Standard German (""Hochdeutsch"", literally ""High German"")."	6993	German_language	98	389
"West Germanic dialects were still spoken in the northern and western regions of Germany and evolved into the regional language now called Low German or Low Saxon (""Plattdeutsch""). For many years the people of these regions of Germany struggled to understand one another. It wasn't until the 1800s that a common language was developed, called Standard German, that allowed the people of the highlands and the lowlands to be able to speak to one another."	6993	German_language	98	452
Some famous authors and poets in this language include the Brothers Grimm (Jacob, 1785 – 1863; Wilhelm, 1786 – 1859), Martin Luther (1483 – 1546), Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (November 10, 1759 – May 9, 1805), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832)	6993	German_language	98	282
German is also the language of classical music, as it was the language of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (January 27, 1756 – December 5, 1791), Ludwig van Beethoven (December 17, 1770 – March 26, 1827), and Johann Sebastian Bach (21 March 1685 – 28 July 1750) just to name a few.	6993	German_language	98	272
The Jellyfish is a marine animal that belongs to the plankton groups. It can be of different colors and different sizes. It has a dome with inside of the mouth and from the dome fall the tentacles that are stinging. It moves thanks to the currents marine. It has got tentacles and a gelatinous dome.	9036	Jellyfish	98	299
Silver Springs is an unincorporated community in Marion County, Florida, United States. It is the site of Silver Springs, a group of artesian springs and a historic tourist attraction that is now part of Silver Springs State Park. The community is part of the Ocala metropolitan area.	11857	Silver_Springs,_Florida	100	284
One of Florida's first tourist attractions, the springs drew visitors even before the U.S. Civil War. Glass-bottom boats have been a popular way to see the 242-acre (98 ha) complex. A small amusement park with various animals, a concert stage, a carousel, and exhibits also developed.	11857	Silver_Springs,_Florida	100	284
The triceratops has a height of 9.5-9.8 feet. It is 9 meters/30 feet long. The triceratops is unique for its three horned face with a beak. It is called the tri-keras-ops meaning three horned face, tri meaning three, keras meaning horns, and ops meaning face.	6097	Triceratops	100	259
The triceratops was alive 67-65 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. The triceratops was first discovered in 1877. The location of fossils found are near Denver and Colorado. The first bone discovered of this Dinosaur was a horn attached to a part of the skull.	6097	Triceratops	100	272
The triceratops is a plant eating herbivore. Triceratops are about the size of an elephant or to put it into weight, it is 4-6 tons. The triceratops has a beak like mouth so it could easily grasp on to plants. The triceratops had 800 teeth that if it lost one tooth it would grow quickly.	6097	Triceratops	100	288
The Taj Mahal was constructed with materials from all over the world, and over 20,000 people were used to move building materials. It is generally thought that Ustad Ahmad Lahauri was in charge of the construction. (*) The construction was finished in 1653. (*)	3639	Taj_Mahal	100	261
"The Bible, also known as Holy Bible is a group of religious texts of Judaism or Christianity. The word Bible comes from the Greek word τὰ βιβλία (biblia) which means ""books"" in English, because it is many books in one book. It includes laws, stories, prayers, songs, and wise words. A number of texts are both in the Hebrew Bible, used by Jews, and this Christian one. The Islamic name for the Bible is the Injil."	5690	Bible	100	413
When talking about the Bible, a book is used to speak about a number of texts. All the texts that make a book are believed to belong together. Most of the time, people believe they were written or collected by the same person. The Bible contains different kinds of such books. Some are history, telling the stories of the Jews, Jesus, or Jesus' followers. Some are collections of wise sayings. Some are God's commands to His people, which He expects them to obey. Some are songs of praise to God. Some are books of prophecy, messages from God that He gave through chosen people called prophets. The Bible is really one great story of salvation.	5690	Bible	100	644
Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. (*) The oldest surviving Christian Bible is the Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek language manuscript from the fourth century AD. (*) The oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts date from the Middle Ages. (*)	5690	Bible	100	305
For a long time the texts were passed on by word of mouth from generation to generation. The Bible was written long ago in Hebrew, Aramaic, and ancient Greek language, and translations were made later into Latin and some other languages. Now there are translations in English and many other languages. The books of the Hebrew text—what Christians call the Old Testament—were not all written at the same time. It took hundreds of years (about 1200 years). The process of putting it all together began around 400 B.C. The New Testament, which was originally written in ancient Greek language, began to be put together in about 100 A.D..	5690	Bible	100	634
A translation is when a scribe takes the source in one language and writes it in another language. Most texts of the Bible were written in ancient Greek or in Aramaic. The New Testament was first translated into English in 1525 by William Tyndale. At the time, people did not have their own Bible at home and only heard it read in Latin in churches. He did it even though at the time it was a crime to translate the Bible into English. Another well known translation is the 1611 King James Translation (commonly known as the Authorized King James Version of the Bible).	5690	Bible	100	569
Some texts were written by historians who tried to show what Ancient Israel was like. Other texts are poems about God and his work. And others were used to make laws. Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible sacred but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible. What is considered part of the Bible changed with history. Different denominations include certain parts or leave out other parts. There is not one single version of the Bible; both the content of the books and their order may change.	5690	Bible	100	524
Today there are dozens of versions of the Bible. Some are translations and some are paraphrases. A paraphrased version is where people take a translation and put it in their own words. As the Bible has been translated into modern languages, it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts. The Bible is the best selling book of all time. 2.5 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date. (*) (*) A complete version of the Bible exists in 471 languages. Parts have been translated in 2225 languages. (*) Most Bibles can be found in the British Museum in London.	5690	Bible	100	617
"The Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books. The first 39 books are the Old Testament. It is the first part of the God's story of salvation. ""Salvation"" is God's long work of saving us from our sins. ""Sin"" is what happened when people decided to live their own way instead of God's way in the world that God created. That was when God began His great work of saving us from our sins."	5690	Bible	100	387
To prepare the way, God had to destroy the whole world by a great flood, except for the family of Noah. Then God raised up a new people for Himself. They were the ancient Hebrews. God promised the Hebrews they would bring His salvation to the whole world.	5690	Bible	100	255
"The first five books of the Old Testament are mostly the story of how God chose the ancient Hebrews and taught them his laws. Following these are the twelve books that tell the history of the Hebrews. The next five are books of poetry and wisdom. One of these five books, the ""Psalms"", is a book of songs showing mainly how God wants to be worshiped."	5690	Bible	100	350
"The last seventeen books of the Old Testament were written by Hebrew prophets. These books tell about God's disappointment with the ancient Hebrews and His promise to bring them back to friendship with Him. The prophets also foretell a great surprise God was planning for the world-He was going to send His very own Son, the Messiah (the ""Anointed One""), the Saviour, to save us from our sins."	5690	Bible	100	393
"The second part is called the New Testament. It was first translated from Greek into English in 1525 by William Tyndale. The main part of this book is the story of the life of Jesus Christ. The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the Gospels. After the Gospels, there is also the story of what happened to the Church after Jesus's death. Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders, especially Saint Paul. One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is John 3:16: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish [die] but have eternal life."" NIV"	5690	Bible	100	659
People have different ideas about the Bible. Christians believe it is God's Word to people. The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God. Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are God's Word. Catholics also believe that the books called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible. Sometimes different denominations disagree over exactly what the Bible means.	5690	Bible	100	407
These proteins are albumin, antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), clotting factors, and protein hormones. Plasma that does not have the protein fibrinogen is called serum and cannot clot. Adults have about 3 liters of plasma. Plasma is a liquid, mostly water (90%). Plasma takes up 55% of blood volume.	7024	Blood	100	306
RBCs are filled with haemoglobin. This is a protein. It is made to carry a large amount of oxygen. Haemoglobin has iron in it. The iron and oxygen gives haemoglobin its red color. This is why blood is red. Erythropoietin promotes the creation of RBCs. Blood type antigens are carried on the surface of red cells.	7024	Blood	100	312
RBCs also help the blood stay normal pH. The blood needs to be at a pH of 7.4. If it is much more or less than 7.4 a person can get very sick or die. RBCs are a buffer for the blood pH. Buffer means that it stops changes in pH. The proteins and the carbon dioxide in the RBC are buffers for the blood. If you do not have enough RBCs, you will die.	7024	Blood	100	347
White blood cells find where the germs are, and start to destroy them. WBCs arrive in the blood. They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection. WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection. If they go out of the blood to fight an infection, they may return in the lymphatic system. So WBCs are in lymph nodes.	7024	Blood	100	339
Another name for white blood cell is leukocyte. Leuko means white. -cyte means cell. WBC is an acronym for white blood cell. There are three main kinds of WBCs. They are lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. Some of the WBCs mature into cells which do similar work in the tissues.	7024	Blood	100	283
The different WBCs work in different ways. Some WBCs kill and eat germs. Some WBCs make antibodies. These are proteins that stick to a cell and tell other WBCs to kill it. Some WBCs make chemicals. They release these chemicals to fight things that do not belong in the body. These chemicals cause inflammation in a part of the body. When a germ makes someone sick, the body shows it. If a bacteria gets under someone's skin and causes an infection, the skin gets red, hot, and painful. This redness, heat, and pain are signs of inflammation. This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria.	7024	Blood	100	615
For blood to be able to clot is essential. But, rarely, some blood clots are bad. If a blood clot happens in a blood vessel going to the brain, it can cause a stroke. If it happens in a blood vessel going to the heart, it can cause a heart attack. This does not usually happen to young, healthy people.	7024	Blood	100	302
"Some people have an illness called Hemophilia. This is when their body doesn't produce the right clotting proteins (or ""factors"") needed to make their blood clot. People with Hemophilia don't have enough of a protein called Factor 8, also known as Anti-hemophilic factor or AHF. They need to have injections of Factor 8 to help their blood to clot properly."	7024	Blood	100	357
Although blood is a fluid, in some respects it is a kind of connective tissue. Its cells originate in bone marrow, the spleen and in the blood there are potential molecular fibres in the form of fibrinogen. These are activated when a blood clot forms.	7024	Blood	100	251
Rome is located in the region of Latium, in the center of Italy. The River Tiber runs through it, 22 kilometers from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its area is approximately 1,285 km², which makes it the largest comune in Italy, exceeding Paris, London, and New York in terms of area. There are 29 comunes bordering Rome.	1934	Rome	100	310
"From the 1980s to the 2000s, the population stagnated and even fell slightly. From 2002 to 2007, the population rose, increasing from 2,800,000 to 2,890,000 inhabitants. Immigrants (particularly from Eastern Europe) have always formed a large community (approximately 360,000 ""legal"" foreigners). Today, it is the fourth most populous city in Europe, after London, Berlin and Madrid."	1934	Rome	100	383
Between the 7th century B.C. and the 1st century A.D., the Roman State, which began as a mere collection of villages on the site of the seven hills of Rome, dramatically expanded its territory until it became the Roman Empire, of which Rome remained the capital. Its system of government was a monarchy, then a republic and, after Julius Caesar, an empire.	1934	Rome	100	356
Under the Empire, the ancient city had about half a million people (the largest city in the world at the time). Many monuments were built: temples, the Roman Forum, the Coliseum. Throughout the Empire, the Romans built Roman cities imitating their capital.	1934	Rome	100	256
With the invasions of Barbarians on Europe, Rome was taken in fifth century AD and as a result was partially destroyed. A thousand years followed during which the activity and the power of the city were reduced. Nevertheless, the city continued to be the seat of Popes, except from 1309 to 1420, when the Popes governed from Avignon, two or three persons claiming to be the Pope in different cities at the same time.	1934	Rome	100	416
After that, the popes brought back to Rome a large part of its splendor, inviting some of the greatest artists, such as Michelangelo and Raphael. The great aristocratic families built palaces such as the Palazzo Farnese and the Palazzo Borghese.	1934	Rome	100	245
Fascism gave Rome a central position. New buildings were built: Mussolini wanted it to become the capital of the Fascist regime. Peri-urban districts and suburbs were developed. The World's Fair of 1942, which was planend to take place there, was cancelled.	1934	Rome	100	257
"Rome has been the setting of a multitude of famous films. It has a large film complex, Cinecittà, where Gladiator, Ben Hur, and Gangs of New York (directed by Martin Scorsese), among others, were shot. Federico Fellini, a well-known Roman director, used Rome for some of his films: his film La Dolce Vita and the scene where Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni bathe in the Trevi Fountain (then relatively unknown) are particularly famous. Sergio Leone shot ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" there."	1934	Rome	100	499
"Many movies are linked to Rome (although some were not shot on the spot), which is mainly due to its history: epics like Gladiator or Ben-Hur, religious and esoteric types like ""Angels and Demons"". Other filmmakers have filmed or performed in the city: Dario Agento, Alberto Sordi, and Vittorio de Sica, among others."	1934	Rome	100	317
Rome has a large number of museums. Located on the Capitoline, the Capitoline Museums constitute a large collection of Roman and Etruscan antiquities. The Villa Borghese has assembled an important collection of sculptures (including several works by Bernini). There are also many museums dedicated to modern and contemporary art. The Vatican Museums welcome several million tourists each year.	1934	Rome	100	393
"Today's traditional Roman cuisine is comprised of dishes with local products (vegetables, fruits, cheese, meat, seafood...). You can taste many types of pasta including the famous ""pasta alla carbonara"", prepared with bacon, cream and egg yolk. The antipasti and bruschettas accompany the meals, typically Mediterranean."	1934	Rome	100	320
"Rome was the cradle of Ancient Rome; the emperors built a great many buildings there and invited artists from throughout the Empire. Roman statuary was greatly inspired by Greek statuary. In fact, numerous Roman marble copies of Greek sculptures (in bronze or stone) have been found. The characteristic of this type of statuary is mainly the realism. However the Romans are different from the Greeks in many ways. The body was ""idealized"" and ""perfect."""	1934	Rome	100	453
The face was very important to the Romans. This was what made it possible to distinguish one emperor from another. It was so that he could decide how he should be depicted. The symbolism was very present, everything was chosen so that it represented something very specific.	1934	Rome	100	274
After Christianity became official, the prestigious Roman art was abandoned. The early Christian art made its appearance (although it already existed for about two centuries). One can find beautiful examples in the catacombs of San Sebastiano. It is characterized by the proliferation of symbols-image (the dove, the Chrism or fish).	1934	Rome	100	333
In the 15th and 16th centuries, Rome also became one of the main centers of diffusion of the Renaissance. The popes and aristocrats attracted the most reputable artists of the time. Some went to study the ancients and Roman art. Michelangelo built St Peter's Cathedral and decorated the Sistine Chapel, Raphael painted many frescoes ...	1934	Rome	100	336
The Baroque was a continuation of the Renaissance, reflecting the desire to impress the church's followers and thus limit the growing influence of the Reformation (Protestantism). Movement and shape were preferred. Bernini was an example of a Baroque artist.	1934	Rome	100	258
With its new status as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, Rome had to adapt to the changes of the modern world. Fascism renovated the city's image. The buildings that were constructed in this period were to be used by the Fascist regime, and were profoundly modern in comparison to the city's ancient history.	1934	Rome	100	319
The Colosseum was the largest of the amphitheaters, with its 50,000 seats and 50-meter height. Built under Vespasian in 72 and unveiled in 80 by his son Titus, it hosted circuses (gladiatorial fights, big cats fight, and mock sea battles, among other things).	1934	Rome	100	259
The Roman Forum was the political, commercial, and judicial heart of the city. Numerous temples and institutions (the Curia, the basilicas, etc.) could be found there. A few emperors had their own forums built (Caesar, Trajan, etc.). The Via Sacra was a road taken during religious processions leading towards the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Market had more than 150 shops at the time. The arcs (of triumph or not) used to glorify the emperor who had built them and were used during religious ceremonies (arcs located on the Via Sacra were triumphal arches).	1934	Rome	100	556
Civil architecture of the city form a rather heterogeneous architectural ensemble from Middle Ages lord palaces to the luxurious papal villas through the square Colosseum, symbol of fascist Italy or modern and contemporary constructions of the EUR.	1934	Rome	100	248
Many town square are very famous. Piazza Venezia is the center of Rome today and yesterday (there are buildings from several eras). The St. Peter's Square in front of St. Peter's Basilica. The square of Spain, or Piazza di Spagna, where his famous stairs can be seen. Piazza Navona was built on a former circus, that is the cause of its oval shape; then Bernini executed there one of his finest works: the Fountain of the Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi).	1934	Rome	100	462
At the time of the annexation of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, being the capital of the country many buildings were built for the needs of the administration: the Quirinal Palace, seat of government; the Palazzo Madama, seat of the Senate; Montecitorio Palace, seat of the Chamber of Deputies or the Koch Palace, headquarters of the Bank of Italy.	1934	Rome	100	347
When Mussolini took power, many things changed. Many historic districts were destroyed to make room for wide avenues and buildings. Architecture was to serve the regime. The peasants had to stay away from the city centre, because what Mussolini feared most was that they would become urban residents: unemployed or workmen. The latter were his worst enemies because they often adhered to socialist and communist political movements, thoughts contrary to fascism. The symbol of this new architecture was the Colosseo Quadrato, located in the EUR district of Rome.	1934	Rome	100	562
"The first religion practiced in Rome was that of the Romans. The Roman religion was polytheistic and made up of a collection of myths and a very detailed mythology. There was a ""cycle"" of ceremonies that they followed scrupulously (the Ides, the Lupercales, etc.…) The ""Penates,"" were creators of household wealth, and the ""Lares,"" were protectors of the household. But with the expansion of the Empire, strange new gods were integrated and mystery cults appeared (Mithra…)."	1934	Rome	100	474
In the 1st Century, Christianity began to spread. However, the Christians became martyrs for their refusal to worship the Roman gods (because Christianity was monotheistic) and to celebrate the cult of the emperor. Some thought them a danger to the cohesiveness of the Empire (this is why Marcus Aurelius allowed the execution of Christians).	1934	Rome	100	342
"With the conversion of Constantine I in 313 and the establishment of the Christian religion in the Empire, the expansion of Christianity began. The Roman religion was rapidly abandoned and many temples were sacked. The major preachers of the era wanted to remove all traces of that ""pagan"" epoch. The first ""official"" churches were built."	1934	Rome	100	338
Rome has a rather dynamic and diverse economy. But the industry did not develop until after the Second World War. This explains a small percentage of employment in this sector (about 20%). It mainly concentrates on the heavy industries, luxury, film, printing (and publishing). More recently, it has turned to the high-technologies. The tertiary sector gathers 75% of active population. The heart of the business area is the Esposizione Universale di Roma (EUR) district.	1934	Rome	100	471
Rome is an important university center and has many schools. There are 528 primary schools, 152 high schools, and, still, 3 art institutes. It is ranked number one in Italy for the number of nursery schools, primary schools, high schools, and secondary schools. La Sapienza University, is one of the oldest (1303) and largest universities in the world (and the largest in Europe) by the number of students (150,000).	1934	Rome	100	416
Rome hosted the Olympic Games in 1960 and the first Paralympic Games the same year. During the third week of May, the Rome Masters or Italian Open take place. It is the second clay court tournament in importance after the tournament at Roland Garros. The Rome Marathon goes through the many historic sites of the city (the Roman Forum, St. Peter ...).	1934	Rome	100	351
When he was 13, Philip hired the Greek philosopher Aristotle to be Alexander's personal tutor. During the next three years, Aristotle gave Alexander a training in rhetoric and literature, and stimulated his interest in science, medicine, and philosophy, all of which became of importance in Alexander's later life.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	314
In 340 BCE, Philip assembled a large Macedonian army and invaded Thrace. He left 16 year old Alexander with the power to rule Macedonia in his absence as regent. But as the Macedonian army advanced deep into Thrace, the Thracian tribe of Maedi bordering north-eastern Macedonia rebelled and posed a danger to the country.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	321
In 334 BCE, he invaded Persian-ruled Asia Minor. He began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the entire Persian Empire. At that point, Alexander's empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	388
He invaded India in 326 BCE, but was forced to turn back at the demand of his troops. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BCE, of unknown causes. Poison, murder, or a fever after a battle have all been suggested. At his death, he was planning a series of campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	311
In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore Alexander's empire apart. Several states were then ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. The largest were the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	250
Conscious of the diversity of the peoples who lived in his empire, Alexander tried to meld them into single people. For that purpose, throughout his expedition towards India, he created cities where he settled European soldiers who would marry natives. Alexander, his friends, and his officers married Persians in a gigantic ceremony at Suse in 325 BCE.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	353
Alexander promoted the birth of a new civilization based on the fusion of the cultures of East and West. The brevity of Alexander's life did not allow him to realize this goal. His successors however did reach this goal. It was called the Hellenistic period. It lasted until the Roman conquest of these countries.	791	Alexander_the_Great	100	313
"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Hindi: मोहनदास करमचन्द गांधी, Mohāndās Karamchand Gāndhī; Gujarati: મોહનદાસ કરમચંદ ગાંધી; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was a leader of nationalism in British-ruled India. He is more commonly called Mahatma Gandhi; (*) mahatma is an honorific meaning ""high-souled"" or ""venerable"" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in South Africa. He is also called Bapu in India (Gujarati endearment for ""father"", ""papa"")."	5557	Mahatma_Gandhi	100	450
Mohandas Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India. (*) Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to England to study law. (*) After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the United Kingdom, but wanted independence.	5557	Mahatma_Gandhi	100	615
People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country.	5557	Mahatma_Gandhi	100	529
In 1947, India became independent from the British Empire and formed two separate countries: India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India.	5557	Mahatma_Gandhi	100	280
"Gandhi's principle of satyagraha, often translated as ""way of truth"" or ""pursuit of truth"", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa)."	5557	Mahatma_Gandhi	100	323
The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark in Paris. It is the symbol of Paris. It was built between 1887 and 1889, for the 100th year of the French Revolution. The Eiffel Tower was the entrance arch for a fair called the Exposition Universelle .Also it was named after Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument in the world .	779	Eiffel_Tower	100	351
It cost £35 million to build. It is 300 metres tall, but this height does not include the 24 m aerial (antenna) on the top; the total height of the structure is 324 m (1058 feet).the same height as a 81 storey building . There are also 1,665 steps inside the Eiffel Tower. It weighs 10,000 tons. It consists of 18,038 pieces and 2 1/2 million rivets. There are 20,000 sparkling lights and 80 kilometers of cables covering the structure. The weight of paint used is 60 tons, and the surface to be painted - 250,000 m2. Three separate colors of paint are used on the Tower in order to enhance the impression of height, with the darkest on the bottom and the lightest at the top.	779	Eiffel_Tower	100	676
It was built by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. There were 107 bids submitted to construct the Eiffel Tower, 50 people worked on the design, and more than 100 built the parts. 132 workers assembled the parts on site. Construction began on January 28, 1887 and was concluded on March 31, 1889.	779	Eiffel_Tower	100	286
When the tower was built, it was only meant to be kept for 20 years. People did not like the Eiffel Tower and wanted it taken down. After the 20 years, the tower became the property of Paris again. By this time, the city had learned that the tower could be used to help with communications. The military used the tower to communicate during battle. Nobody wanted it to be taken apart.	779	Eiffel_Tower	100	384
Walt Disney World is a theme park and resort in Orlando, Florida, that is divided into four parks: which are The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and The Animal Kingdoms. It includes the Monorail, which goes to Disney's Contemporary Resort, Transportation and Ticket Center, (connecting route to Epcot), Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, and the Magic Kingdom. It is the largest theme park in the world. (*)	7955	Walt_Disney_World	100	455
Ancient Greece was a vast region in the northwestern Mediterranean where the Greek was spoken. It was much larger than the Greece we know today. It was the civilisation of Greece in the Archaic period from the 8th/6th century BC to 146 BC. This period ended with the conquest of Greece by Roman at the Battle of Corinth.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	320
For most of this period, the Greeks had no single government or ruler. There were a number of city-states, each with its own constitution. Athens, Sparta and Corinth are examples. Some had kings, others, like Athens, had a form of democracy.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	241
In the middle of this period is classical Greece, which flourished from the 5th to the 4th century BC. Athenian leaders succeeded in annihilating the Persian threat in the Greco-Persian Wars. Athens' golden age ended with the city's defeat by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	285
Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe. In this way, Classical Greece was part of the foundation of Western civilization. Greek was also the language, and partly the culture, of the Byzantine Empire.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	303
The Classical Period (ca. 500-323 BC) is characterised by a style considered by later observers to be classical; the Parthenon is a good example. Politically, the classical period was dominated by Athens and the Delian League during the 5th century; but this was supplanted by Sparta in the early 4th century BC. Finally, there was the League of Corinth, which was led by Macedonia.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	382
In the 8th century B.C., the Greeks learned how to read and write a second time. They had lost literacy at the end of the Mycenaean culture, as the Mediterranean world fell into the Dark Ages. The Greek Dark Ages (~1100 BC–750 BC), or Bronze Age collapse, is a period in the history of Ancient Greece and Anatolia from which there are no records, and few archaeological remains.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	378
The Greeks learned about the alphabet from another ancient people, the Phoenicians. They made some adjustments to it. In particular, the Greeks introduced regular letters for vowels, which was necessary for their language. Their alphabet was, in turn, copied by the Romans, and much of the world now uses the Roman alphabet.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	324
Ancient Greece had one language and culture, but was not unified until 337 BC, when Macedonia defeated Athens and Thebes. That marked the end of the Classic period, and the start of the Hellenistic period. Even then, the conquered cities were merely joined to the Corinthian League; they were not occupied, and ruled themselves.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	328
"Undoubtedly the geography of Greece—divided and sub-divided by hills, mountains and rivers—contributed to the nature of ancient Greece. On the one hand, the ancient Greeks had no doubt that they were 'one people'; they had the same religion, same basic culture, and same language. Yet each city state or ""polis"" was independent; unification was something rarely discussed by the ancient Greeks. Even when, during the second Persian invasion of Greece, a group of city-states allied themselves to defend Greece, most poleis remained neutral, and after the Persian defeat, the allies quickly returned to infighting. (*)"	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	617
Later, in the Classical period, the leagues were fewer and larger, and dominated by one city (particularly Athens, Sparta and Thebes). Often cities would be compelled to join under threat of war (or as part of a peace treaty). Even after Philip II of Macedon 'conquered' the heartlands of ancient Greece, he did not attempt to annex the territory, or unify it into a new province, but simply compelled most of the poleis to join his own Corinthian League.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	455
Some cities were democratic, some were aristocratic, and some were monarchies. Some had many revolutions in which one kind of government replaced another. One famous Greek kingdom is Macedon, which became briefly the largest empire the world had seen at the time by conquering the Persian empire (including ancient Egypt) and reaching into modern-day India. Other famous kingdoms are Epirus and Thessaly.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	404
Monarchies in ancient Greece were not absolute because there was usually a council of older citizens (the senate, or in Macedonia the congress) who gave advice to the King. These men were not elected or chosen in a lottery like they were in the democratic city-states.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	268
"Citizens in Ancient Greece were usually men who were free-born in that city. Women, slaves and (usually) residents born elsewhere, did not have the right to vote. Details differed between cities. Athens is an example: The men of Athens were of three groups: citizens, metics (resident aliens) and slaves. (*) Citizens were men (over 17) whose forebears had been Athenians for three generations. They had the rights of free men and could be elected any official state position. ""Of the estimated 150,000 residents of the city state of Attica, only about one fifth held the privilege of citizenship"". (*)"	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	602
Because the terrain was rough, most travel was by sea. For this reason, many new cities were established along the coastline. First new cities were started in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and later along the Black Sea, in Cyprus, in southern Italy, in Sicily, and around what today is Benghazi in Libya. They even started a city, Naucratis, on the river Nile in Egypt. The cities of today, Syracuse, Naples, Marseille and Istanbul started as the Greek cities Syracusa, Neapolis, Massilia and Byzantium.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	495
"The Spartans were very well disciplined soldiers. They defeated the people who lived near them and those people had to farm the land for the Spartans. These ""helots"" had to give the Spartans part of the food they grew and so the Spartans did not have to work. Instead, they learned how to be better soldiers. There were not many Spartans but there were many helots. Spartan military strength controlled the helots. The Spartans had two hereditary kings who led them in war. At home they were also ruled by a group of old men called the Gerousia (the senate)."	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	558
Athens became a democracy in 510 BC. The men came to a place in the center of the city and decided what to do. It was the first place in the world where the people decided what their country should do. They would talk and then vote on what to do at the Boule (the parliament). But the women did not vote. Athens had slaves. These slaves were owned by their masters and could be sold to someone else. The Athenian slaves were less free than the Spartan helots. Every year, Athenian citizens elected eight generals who led them in war.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	533
In 499 BC, the Greek cities in Anatolia rebelled. They did not want Persia to rule them anymore. Athens sent 20 ships to fight the Persians on the sea. The Greeks in Anatolia were defeated. The Persian King, Darius decided to punish Athens. He sent soldiers and ships to fight Athens.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	284
Athens asked for help from Sparta. Sparta wanted to help but could not; they had a religious festival at that time. Athens sent her soldiers against the Persian soldiers: at the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) they defeated the Persians. Then the help from Sparta came.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	265
At the Battle of Thermopylae The Spartans were led by Leonidas, and resisted the huge Persian army. After a couple of days, a traitor called Ephialtes led the Persians around the pass behind the Greek army. Realising that defeat was inevitable, Leonidas released many of his men. Those who stayed knew it would be a fight to the death. Leonides kept elite hoplites (foot soldiers) who had living sons at home. (*) There were also allied Thespians and Thebans who volunteered to stay.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	483
On the third day, Leonidas led his 300 Spartan hoplites and their allies against Xerxes and his mighty army. The Spartan-led forces fought this Persian force to their deaths in order to block the pass long enough to keep Xerxes and his army occupied while the rest of the Greek army escaped.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	291
Athens was north of Corinth and she had a navy. Athens' leader Themistocles wanted to fight the Persians by the island of Salamis. Xerxes decided to send his fleet against the Greek fleet before the Greek ships could go to the Peloponnese. The Greek fleet defeated the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes then went home with many of his soldiers but a Persian army stayed in Greece. This army was defeated at the Battle of Platea in 479 BC.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	446
After the Persians were defeated at Platea, the Spartans did very little. However Persia sent its ships across the sea to help Greek cities in Anatolia fight for their freedom. Athens asked the Greek cities on the islands in the Aegean and in Anatolia to join her. These cities agreed because they were afraid of Persia. These cities formed the Delian League and Athens was their leader. Many of the cities had to pay Athens money. Athens used the money to build many ships. Sparta was still strong on land, but Athens was stronger on the sea. Several times there was war between Athens and Sparta. Then Athens decided to send many ships to Sicily to fight against the city Syracuse. Sparta sent help to Syracuse, and Athens was defeated. None of the Athenian ships came back.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	776
Now Sparta decided to build ships to fight Athens. It took a long time for Sparta to defeat Athens but then at the Battle of Aegospotami the Spartans destroyed most of Athens's ships. The Athenians used a highly advanced type of ship known as triremes. These highly advanced battle craft were equipped with sophisticated combat systems, and were propelled by oarsmen. On the front of the trireme was a large bronze ram. The trireme would row itself at an enemy boat very fast, and ram a hole into its hull. This was the most effective way for the trireme to destroy other boats. Sometimes, the soldiers (called hoplites) on the trireme would board the ship and keep it for their own.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	683
Men, if not working, fighting or discussing politics, could, at festival times, go to Ancient Greek theatre to watch dramas, comedies or tragedies. These often involved politics and the gods of Greek mythology. Women were not allowed to perform in the theatre: male actors played female roles.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	293
The famous ancient Olympic Games were held at Olympia every four years. They were for men only, and women were not allowed to attend, even as spectators. The sports included running, javelin throwing, discus throwing and wrestling. The Games were unusual, because the athletes could come from any Greek city.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	308
The rules for girls in Sparta were different from other cities. They were trained in the same events as boys, because Spartans believed that strong women would produce strong future warriors. Their girl athletes were unmarried and competed nude or wearing short dresses. Boys were allowed to watch the athletes, in the hopes of creating marriages and offspring.	4780	Ancient_Greece	100	361
Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex for short, was a dinosaur that lived on Earth about 65 to 70 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. T. rex is one of the largest carnivorous (meat-eating) dinosaurs ever discovered. It is also quite likely the best-known dinosaur of all.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	276
Tyrannosaurus rex was up to 13 meters long and 5 meters tall, and weighed 4 to 6 tons – longer than a bus, and heavier than an elephant. It had a forward tilt, deep jaws, huge teeth, a long tail, and tiny arms (also known as forelimbs). T. rexs jaw alone was about 1.3 meters long and had fifty to sixty bone-crunching teeth that were up to 10 centimeters or 6 inches long. Its arms were very stubby, no longer than a human being's. They were very strong, able to lift up to two hundred kilograms, but were not long enough to touch each other! T. rex stood on two powerful hind legs, each ending with a three-toed foot, resembling a bird's foot, only much larger.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	663
Was it really the largest predator? In 1995, parts of a predator that seems even larger than T. rex were found in Argentina! It was called Giganotosaurus and was about 45 ft long (about a meter [yard] longer than T. rex). Since then, parts of even larger carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Spinosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, have been found.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	339
T. rex was a very big meat-eating dinosaur, also called a carnivore. It would have been at the top of the food chain. It is known to have fed on other large dinosaurs, such as Edmontosaurus, Anatosaurus, and Triceratops, and probably could have swallowed smaller dinosaurs in a single bite.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	290
One scientist believes that T. rex was a scavenger (an animal that eats already dead animals). He argues that it might not have been fast enough to catch prey. Other scientists believe that T. rex probably scavenged and hunted, like most living meat-eaters (such as tigers and lions). T. rex bite marks found on the bones of Edmontosaurus and Triceratops that have healed show that Tyrannosaurus did hunt at least some of the time – and also that its prey was sometimes lucky enough to escape.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	493
Tyrannosaurus is believed to have lived in forests, near rivers, and in areas that were open and full of prey. Mild seasons would have been most favourable to it. Tyrannosaurus fossils have been found in western North America and possibly Asia.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	244
The famous fossil hunter Barnum Brown found the first Tyrannosaurus fossil in 1905. Tyrannosaurus was not the dinosaur's name until 1905, when it was given that name by Henry Fairfield Osborn. About 3,000 Tyrannosaurus fossils have been found, from pieces of teeth to nearly complete skeletons. Only one possible Tyrannosaurus footprint has been found.	765	Tyrannosaurus	100	352
A Roman numeral is the name for a number when it is written in the way the Romans used to write numbers. Roman numerals are not used very often today in the west. They are used to write the names of kings and queens, or popes. For example: Queen Elizabeth II. They may be used to write the year a book or movie was made.	757	Roman_numeral	100	320
Especially on clocks and watches, IIII can sometimes still be found. This is done partly because the IIII for the 4 o'clock position aesthetically balances the VIII for the 8 o'clock position. Also, some use it as a metaphor that IIII was commonplace in an period of time earlier than the idea of subtraction - IX - was introduced into writing Roman numerals. (4:00 comes earlier in the day than 9:00.)	757	Roman_numeral	100	402
Proper form is to subtract only a value with the next lower power of 10. Thus, 900 is written CM, but 990 would not be XM - properly, it is CM for the 900 portion and XC for the 90 portion, or CMXC. Similarly, 999 would not be IM but rather CMXCIX - CM for the 900 portion, XC for the 90 portion, and IX for the 9 portion. Only values with 1's are ever used to subtract; 45 is properly XLV, not VL. (*)	757	Roman_numeral	100	402
When people write about Monarchs or Popes, Patriarchs, or other leading figures, they are sometimes counted with Roman numbers, e.g. Queen Elizabeth II (of England), Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, Patriarch Alexius II (of the Russian-Orthodox church)	757	Roman_numeral	100	257
"An electric circuit is a path in which electrons from a voltage or current source flow. Electric current flows in a closed path called an electric circuit. The point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the ""source"" of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the ""return"" or ""earth ground"". The exit point is called the ""return"" because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit."	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	490
"The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's ""load"". The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power electrical appliances like refrigerators, televisions, or lamps or more complicated, such as the load on the output of a hydroelectricpower generating station."	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	398
Circuits use two forms of electrical power: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by coal, hydroelectric, nuclear and other large power plants. DC powers battery, PoE and USB operated vehicles, tools, toys and small appliances, as well as electronic circuits with LEDs (e.g., lighting, monitors, TVs), sensors and computer logic (e.g., networking, cell phones, tablets, laptops). DC power can easily be converted from AC or produced directly from solar, wind and other generators.	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	553
Electronic circuits usually use low voltage direct current sources. The load of an electronic circuit may be as simple as a few resistors, capacitors, and a lamp, all connected together to create the flash in a digital camera. Or an electronic circuit can be complicated, connecting thousands of resistors, capacitors, and transistors to create the microprocessors that make computers possible.	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	394
"Electrical and electronic circuits can be complicated. Making a drawing of the connections to all the component parts in the circuit's load makes it easier to understand how circuit components are connected. Drawings for electronic circuits are called ""circuit diagrams"". Drawings for electrical circuits are called ""wiring diagrams"". Circuit diagrams and wiring diagrams are usually drawn by skilled draftsmen, and then printed. But they can also be simple pencil sketches drawn by technicians or other workers."	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	512
Wiring and circuit diagrams use special symbols recognized by everyone who uses the drawings. The symbols on the drawings show how components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, motors, outlet boxes, lights, switches, and other electrical and electronic components are connected together. The diagrams are a big help when workers try to find out why a circuit does not work correctly.	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	387
"The current flowing in an electrical or electronic circuit can suddenly increase when a component part fails. This can cause serious damage to other components in the circuit, or create a fire hazard. To protect against this, a fuse or a device called a ""circuit breaker"" can be wired into a circuit. The circuit breaker will open, or ""break"", the circuit when the current in that circuit becomes too high, or the fuse will ""blow"". This gives protection."	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	454
The standard return for electrical and electronic circuits is the earth ground. When an improperly designed electrical or electronic device fails, it may open the return circuit to the earth ground. The user of the device could become a part of the device's electrical circuit by providing a return path for the electrons through the user's body instead of the circuit's earth ground. When the user's body becomes part of an electrical circuit, the user can be seriously shocked, or even killed by electrocution.	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	512
To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution, ground fault interrupt devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices. When an open circuit to earth ground is detected, the GFI device immediately opens the voltage source to the device. GFI devices are similar to circuit breakers, but are designed to protect humans rather than circuit component.	5581	Electrical_circuit	100	421
Limestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate. It is originally made by small photosynthetic protists like certain bacteria, coccolithophores, and algae. Then the carbonate gets used by various animals, like bivalves and the polyps which make coral reefs. They build their shells or framework out of CaCO3 crystals. (*)	5585	Limestone	100	321
Carbonates are rocks formed from these sources, plus any CaCO3 which is precipitated out of solution. Some carbonate dissolves in the water. It gets precipitated when the physical condition of the water changes. For example, if the concentration of CaCO3 is high, then a temperature drop, or a pH (acidity) change, can cause precipitation.	5585	Limestone	100	339
In the Florida Bay a type of flowering plant called sea grass is in abundance. Also in abundance is white, milky water full of calcium carbonate. This is mainly formed by Melobesia, a small red alga which lives on the sea grass.p151 Finally, the organisms produce huge amounts of slime, which is a polysaccharide. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by microorganisms to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed.p139 As a side-effect the slime limits the amount of carbonate which goes into solution.p155	5585	Limestone	100	532
Many limestones contain fossils, and some are made up almost entirely of skeletal material. Chalk is ~99% coccoliths; Solnhofen limestone is famous for its animal fossils; and there are many shelly limestones from different periods. Limestone is not found much before the Cambrian period, because shelled animals had not yet evolved. (*)	5585	Limestone	100	337
When limestone is heated to a high temperature, and squeezed at the base of a mountain, it becomes the metamorphic rock marble. Marbles are fairly dense, relatively easy to cut, or be shaped into blocks, and some forms are white in colour. (*)	5585	Limestone	100	243
Limestone is hard enough to resist weathering but usually soft enough to be worked (cut and carved) by stonemasons. It is used for building material. Limestone, particularly Portland limestone, became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as churches, banks and houses.	5585	Limestone	100	295
Divided between the Æsir and the Vanir, and sometimes including the jötnar (giants), the dividing line between these groups is less than clear. However, it is usually accepted that the Æsir (including Óðinn, Þór and Týr) were warrior gods, while the Vanir (mainly Njörður, Freyja and Freyr) were fertility gods. Various other groups of beings, including elves, dwarves and jötnar were probably minor gods, and might have had small cults and sacred places devoted to them.	5592	List_of_Norse_gods_and_goddesses	100	471
The Sun is the star around which the Earth, and the whole solar system turns. Viewed from the Earth, the Sun appears as a circle of light in the sky. The rotation of the Earth around itself makes the Sun seems to turn around the Earth. The Sun rises in the East, and sets in the West.	2070	Sun	100	284
"The sun was born five billion years ago. The best explanation for how it came to exist is the ""nebular hypothesis"". This assumes that the universe already existed (so it's after the big bang). A large cloud of dust and gas, spinning around, slowly started to get tighter and tighter around the sun, and most of what settled near the sun became our solar system; the planets with the sun at the centre, the stars, the other minor planets, comets, and then, asteroids."	2070	Sun	100	466
Egyptian pyramids are tombs built in the geometric shape of pyramids. They were built by pharaohs in ancient Egypt. The pyramids are one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They oldest, and the only ones that have resisted through until now the effects of time and earthquakes.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	284
The Pyramids of Giza are the best known because they are the largest, the most complete and the best conserved today, but other pyramids were built before and after them. We can note the technical evolution of the pyramids over the centuries. Before the pyramids, the graves of the pharaohs and of high characters were mastabas, large square tombs covering cellars and funerary chambers.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	387
Then the Kings of the Fourth Dynasty made pyramids with smooth faces, which became objects of perfect geometrical form, henceforth and for a long time the tallest and the largest constructions built by man. The pyramids of Egypt are situated on the long desert limestone plateau which stretches above the left bank of the Nile.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	327
The first pyramid is that of King Djeser (or Djoser), of the Third Dynasty who ruled before 2800 BCE. At first a simple mastaba, it was subjected to a succession of expansions and elevations, until becoming an immense monument of 109 x 121 meters, with a height of 62 meters	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	274
Step pyramid of Sekhemkhet. Sekhemkhet, Djeser's successor didn't have the time to make his own step pyramid, predicted to reach a height of about 70 metres above a base of 120 x 120 metres. Several portions of foundation remain, just reaching about ten meters. A large complex of corridors and well conserved underground storerooms, leads to central burial chamber.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	366
Maidum Pyramid (kings Huni and Snefru) The Pyramid situated close to Meidoum, at the entrance of the large irrigated plain of Fayoum, resembles from a distance a huge ice cream halfway melted. This pyramid, by its halfway collapsed state reveals to us all its structure: there is no doubt, the Pharaohs and their architects had an unlimited taste for experimentation!	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	367
Not content with the feat, his successor Snefrou (Fourth Dynasty, reigning from around 2575 BCE) realized an entirely new idea: he dresses the great step pyramid with a lining carefully laid on the sides of the walls. Giving the monument the aspect of a pyramid with smooth faces with a base of 144 meters and a height of 92 metres. The angle of this smooth pyramid is 51 degrees, that is to say very steep.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	407
The most likely hypothesis is that this pyramid collapsed when it was completed or about to be. It can be distinguished in the diagram and the photo caption, how much of the building owned visible elements or refurbished parts correspond to the outer walls, while the rumble strips were originally concealed parties.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	316
The irregular or rhomboidal pyramid at Dahshur (just south of Gaza) is also attributed to Snefru. It marks an important step in the development of the pyramids' architecture sometimes it has a smooth limestone surface and two rooms connected by a narrow casing, but each filled in a descending passage The northern descending passage leads to an underground chamber, while the second descending passage on the west - configuration not found elsewhere - leads to another room above the other, in the masonry itself.

Salvagers had begun to remove the stones from one corner of the pyramid, thus revealing the crude, cheaply done, internal masonry. From the outside, this pyramid looks like the best preserved of all, but inside, the entrances, situated at staggering heights, lead to cracked and sagging descending corridors that do not inspire confidence. The rooms are greatly damaged, halfway filled in and supported by struts, probably since their creation.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	444
Pyramide rouge (de Snéfrou)Red Pyramid (Sneferu) Unlike the previous two, Snefru's architects seemed to have played it safe for this third pyramid which, probably, satisfied him enough finally to establish his burial chamber there. For all his three pyramids together, Snefru moved no less than 3.3 million cubic meters of stone, which most certainly makes it the largest architectural project in the entire history of mankind.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	427

"The Pyramid of Cheops (Khufu in the language of the Egyptians), built around -2560, is the most massive (base 230 m) and the highest of all (146 m). The interior network of corridors and rooms is complex and mysterious, with its descending corridor and it's unfinished subterranean chamber, and it's ascending column which leads firstly to the ""Queen's chamber"", via a horizontal column on the other hand is the ""King's chamber"" by the ""great gallery"" with a vast cantilevered ceiling. The Great Pyramid was entirely covered in a coating of fine polished limestone, of which there remains only the first layer. The rest, removed with the aid of levers and restored by quarrymen, has been used since the Middle Ages in the construction of monuments in Cairo."	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	757
However, one has several doubts on the architectural success of this assembly, if one considers that the funerary chamber of the King, the final goal of the operation, is gravely and irredimably cracked under the weight, very probably in the concluding phase of the monument.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	275

The second pyramid, built around 2540 BCE., is that of Chephren (Khafre, in the language of the Egyptians). It's almost as big as it's predecessor with a base of 215 meters, it reaches a height of 143 meters, with a very accentuated slope of 53 degrees, in a ratio of 4/3. It retains, at its summit, a good part of its polished limestone surface, clearly showing how the stone facing, suspended overhead, is locked to the mass of masonry. The interior arrangements include a chamber flush with the ground, and another underground. They are of a modest appearance, corresponding so little to the Pharaonic splendour, that one has always suspected the existence of other chambers, never discovered. The tunnels, made deep in the mass of the pyramid, testify to this very ancient conviction.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	788
The lost sarcophagus of Mykerinos - The pyramid of Mykerinos (Monkaoure, in the language of the Egyptians), dates from around 2520 BCE. It is the smallest of the three pyramids of Giza, with half of the dimensions of its two predecessors: a base of 105 meters, and a height of 65 meters. The angle is 51 degrees, according to the ratio of 14/11. They say that the volume of this pyramid represents hardly a tenth of its neighbors: a good exercise is to check it out! The pyramid has kept, at the base, a well established Aswan granite surface, not refaced. We also know that the tallest part of the monument was very simply covered with thin limestone. We think that this incompleteness is due to the premature death of the King.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	729
Found along the left bank of the Nile are around 80 pyramids, all of which are tombs of the Kings and the dignitaries of ancient Egypt. The masters of Egypt had continued to build pyramids during the centuries after those of Giza! But these more recent pyramids, even if their distribution and their interior decoration are of great interest, resemble shapeless hills or mounds of ruins, or even, more often heaps of sand and pebbles. Without doubt the successors of the Kings of the 4th dynasty, no longer had the means, the manpower, or the materials, to do as well as their glorious ancestors.	5605	Pyramids_of_Egypt	100	596
Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly. Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times. The idiom shape up or ship out, which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you don't, might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee, but not to other people.	5626	Idiom	100	411
To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language, and how and when to use them. But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings. In order to understand an idiom, one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from.	5626	Idiom	100	324
"To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting, but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly. For example, most native British English speakers know that ""No room to swing a cat"" means ""there was not a lot of space"" and can use the idiom properly, but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a ""cat o'nine tails"". [citation needed] A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to swing the cat."	5626	Idiom	100	524
A child prodigy is a person who, at a very early age develops one or more skills at a level far beyond the norm for their age. A prodigy is a child aged 18 years old or younger. A child prodigy performs at the level of a highly trained adult in a very demanding field of endeavour.	4998	Child_prodigy	100	281
Chocolate is a food made from the seeds of a cacao tree. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, and ice cream. It can be a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. The taste of chocolate is often described as sweet because chocolate makers usually add a lot of sugar and milk for taste. This means that chocolate can be bad for your health. It is best to eat chocolate in moderation.	5292	Chocolate	100	437
There are three main types of chocolate: white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter ingredients in it. White chocolate does not have any cocoa in it. It is mostly made of cocoa butter. Milk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has some cocoa. Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor. Dark chocolate has up to 60-85 percent cocoa (which is really bitter).	5292	Chocolate	100	529
Chocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some animals, like dogs, become sick if they eat chocolate. People with diabetes can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight disease. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of heart disease because of polyphenol in chocolate. It is necessary to eat moderate amount of chocolate. (*)	5292	Chocolate	100	440
Making chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the cacao beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and vanilla. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth, instead of smooth. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Conching for several hours makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times.	5292	Chocolate	100	1231
There are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are caffeine and theobromine. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each chemical varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate.	5292	Chocolate	100	364
"The cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago. Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important people could drink it. The word for ""chocolate"" in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, chocolatl."	5292	Chocolate	100	364
Later on, this drink was made sweeter and made into the treat that is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain. (*) When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy, it became a very popular treat for many Europeans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in Africa. Some is made in India.	5292	Chocolate	100	423
The ships sailing into The First Fleet is the name given to the 11 ships which sailed from Great Britain on 13 May 1787, to start the first European colony in New South Wales. It was the beginning of a plan to transport thousands of prisoners to Australia to make convict settlements. The fleet was led by Captain Arthur Phillip. This journey lasted eight months, and used a route across the oceans that had only been used three times; once by Abel Tasman and twice by James Cook.	5301	First_Fleet	100	480
There were two navy ships, six convict transports and three storeships. The private ships were on contract to the British Government. The contracts were organized by William Richards, a shipbroker (ship salesman) from Walworth. He also supplied the food and drink for the ships. Zachariah Clarke went with the Fleet to look after things for Richards. (*)	5301	First_Fleet	100	354
The convict ships were set up in the same way as soldiers were transported. People slept in hammocks and there were tables for eating and stools to sit on. To keep the convicts secure, thick wooden walls were built across the deck (floor) from side to side. These had small holes in them so the guards could shoot in case of trouble. The hatches (doors up to the decks) were kept shut with cross bars, bolts and locks. Guards were almost always on duty at each hatch, and a guard with a gun was always on the quarter deck.	5301	First_Fleet	100	522
Some of the convicts were taken to the transport ships at London, and the rest went on board at Plymouth. Many, especially those from smaller country gaols were not in good health. Phillip thought that he might have to make one of the ships a hospital ship to care for the sick.:154 Newspapers wrote that they expected about 80% of the convicts would not survive the long journey.:54 Several of the convicts died and some of marines were so sick that they were removed from the ships before they left England.:125 The number of people that died on the trip was quite small, and shows that the planning and treatment of the convicts was successful.:156 Most had put on weight and were healthier when they arrived in Australia than when they left England.:155	5301	First_Fleet	100	757
As well as this food, there was sometimes rice, dried fish, and soup. When the ships were in a harbour there was also fresh meat and vegetables. Women and children were given a slightly different list of food. Sick people were also given wine and spirits.	5301	First_Fleet	100	255
The Fleet also took a number of animals, plants and seeds. The animals included sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, goats, turkeys, geese, ducks, chickens, pigeons, horses, and cattle. Plants and seeds included coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, oranges, lemons, tamarinds, guava, prickly pear, eugenia or pomme rose, jalap, ipecacuanha, figs, bamboo, sugar cane, esparto grass, vines, quinces, apples, pears, strawberries, oaks, myrtles, rice, wheat, barley, and maize. Some of this was brought from England, and the rest from when the Fleet stopped at Rio de Janeiro and Capetown.	5301	First_Fleet	100	568
On 3 June 1787, the fleet arrived at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. On 10 June they left to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro. The weather was very hot and there were lots of storms.:87 Many people became sick and there were lots of rats, bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas.:87 People were only allowed to drink three pints of water each day.:88	5301	First_Fleet	100	399
The first ship, Supply, reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Aboriginal people from the Cadigal tribe saw the First Fleet ships arrive. (*) Phillip soon decided that this site, picked by Sir Joseph Banks, was not suitable. It had poor soil, no safe place to leave the ships, and no drinking water. Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson.	5301	First_Fleet	100	344
On 26 January the marines and convicts arrived at Sydney Cove. 1403 people left Portsmouth. On the voyage 7 babies were born. 69 people died or left the ships. 1332 people landed in Port Jackson which is now known as Sydney. It was a successful trip, as only 40 convicts had died. Phillip named the settlement Sydney after Lord Sydney, the British government's Home Secretary.	5301	First_Fleet	100	376
The Aboriginal people from the Eora nation lived in the Sydney area. (*) They could not understand why the British wanted to own their land and make farms with fences. The British did not understand the Aboriginal people's way of living and there was a lot of fighting and many people died.	5301	First_Fleet	100	290
His father was Phidias, an astronomer, and he may have been in the family of a king of Syracuse. Syracuse was a rich Greek city, on the sea shore in Sicily. When Archimedes was about ten years old, he left Syracuse to study in Alexandria, Egypt. He was in the school of Euclid, a famous mathematician. Not much is known about the personal life of Archimedes, for example, whether he was married or if he had children. He died during a Roman invasion.	5311	Archimedes	100	450
Archimedes is also well known for being the first person to understand statics, which is a part of applied mathematics. It has to do with loads that do not move, for example in buildings or bridges. He also understood and wrote about what happens when things float in liquids, which is called buoyancy.	5311	Archimedes	100	302
"A legend about Archimedes tells how he was sitting in his bath one day. Suddenly, he thought of how to tell if the King's crown was made of pure gold. He was so excited that he forgot to put on his clothes and ran naked through the streets shouting ""Eureka!"", meaning ""I have found it!"". The story of the golden crown does not appear in the writing of Archimedes. Archimedes may have got a solution known in hydrostatics as Archimedes' principle, which he describes in his writing On Floating Bodies. This idea says that a body immersed in water feels a buoyant force equal to the weight of the water it displaces. (*) Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then placing the scale in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip. Galileo considered it ""probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself"". (*)"	5311	Archimedes	100	1097
Archimedes probably also invented a machine to measure distance, an odometer. A cart was built with wheels that turned four hundred times in one mile. A pin on the wheel would hit a 400-tooth gear, so it turned once for every mile. This gear would then make a small stone fall into a cup. At the end of a journey one could count the number of stones in the cup to find the distance.	5311	Archimedes	100	382
Archimedes also made a system which one person could pull a large ship with just one rope. This was called the compound pulley. This is an important machine even today, as it helps people in everyday life, although the versions we now use are much more complicated. They still work by the same principle, though.	5311	Archimedes	100	312
"Archimedes also invented or made many machines used in war, for example he made better catapults. This was during the Punic Wars, which were between Rome in what is now Italy and the city of Carthage in what is now North Africa. For many years he helped stop the Roman army from attacking Syracuse, his city. One war machine was called the ""claw of Archimedes"", or the ""iron hand"". It was used to defend the city from attacks by ships. Ancient writers said that it was a kind of crane with a hook that lifted ships out of the water and caused their destruction."	5311	Archimedes	100	561
After many years the Roman army took the city of Syracuse. One of the soldiers killed Archimedes, who was then an old man. The soldiers had perhaps been told to catch Archimedes alive, so it may have been a mistake. The story is that Archimedes was killed while drawing a mathematical diagram in the sand. He was so busy with his drawing that he did not see the soldier behind him. His famous last words were, “Don’t disturb my circles!”	5311	Archimedes	100	437
After appearing on various Disney shows, Spears rose to fame as a singer with her albums ... Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops! ... I Did It Again (2000). In 2001 she released the album Britney and starred in the movie Crossroads which received bad reviews, but managed to raise money. Around this time, she decided to project a less innocent image by dancing with a python at a music awards ceremony.	13476	Britney_Spears	100	402
She married a singer-dancer in 2004, and they had two children. They divorced in 2008 due to certain mental problems. Spears lost custody of her children (the right to see and look after them). She later regained half-custody rights with the father, but the issue has been the subject of several lawsuits. She was also during 13 years under the conservatorship of her father, James Parnell Spears, which prevented her from doing certain things like driving or traveling without his permission.	13476	Britney_Spears	100	493
Shield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions (without explosions). Because the lava is so fluid, it spreads out, often over a wide area. Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height, and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently sloping sides. Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of basalt, which is usually what lava is when cooled.	5373	Volcano	100	383
Even though their sides are not very steep, shield volcanoes can be huge. Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the biggest mountain on Earth. If it is measured from its base on the floor of the sea, Mauna Kea is even taller than Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on land. (*)	5373	Volcano	100	263
Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, with high-to-intermediate levels of silica, and less mafic magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . (*)	5373	Volcano	100	394
Two famous stratovolcanoes are Japan's Mount Fuji, and Vesuvius. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79 AD, killing thousands.	5373	Volcano	100	259
Parts of a volcano: 1. Large magma chamber 2. Bedrock 3. Conduit (pipe) 4. Base 5. Sill 6. Branch pipe 7. Layers of ash emitted by the volcano 8. Flank 9. Layers of lava emitted by the volcano 10. Throat 11. Parasitic cone 12. Lava flow 13. Vent 14. Crater 15. Ash cloud	5373	Volcano	100	270
Volcanoes are made when two tectonic plates come together. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the oceanic plate) goes under the continental plate. This is the process of subduction. Afterwards, it melts and makes magma (inside the magma chamber), and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earth's crust.	5373	Volcano	100	337
A traditional way to classify or identify volcanoes is by its pattern of eruptions. Those volcanoes which may erupt again at any time are called active. Those that are now quiet called dormant (inactive). Those volcanos which have not erupted in historical times are called extinct.	5373	Volcano	100	282
The Earth's largest volcano has been discovered. (*) It is 2 km below the sea on an underwater plateau known as the Shatsky Rise. This is about 1,600 km east of Japan. The previous record-holder, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, is still the largest volcano on land.	5373	Volcano	100	254
The 310,000 km2 (119,000 sq mi) volcano, Tamu Massif, is comparable in size to Mars' vast Olympus Mons volcano, which is the largest in the Solar System. It was formed about 145 million years ago when massive lava flows erupted from the centre of the volcano to form a broad, shield-like feature. That suggests the volcano produced a flood basalt eruption.	5373	Volcano	100	356

"""There were lots of oceanic plateaus (that) erupted during the Cretaceous period (145-65 million years ago) but we don't see them since. Scientists would like to know why...

Palms are one of the best known and most widely planted tree families. They have held an important role for humans throughout much of history. Many common products and foods come from palms. They are often used in parks and gardens that are in areas that do not have heavy frosts.	5376	Palm_tree	100	280
Most palm trees grow in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They occur from about 44° northern latiude to about 44° southern latitude. The dwarf palm (Chamaerops humilis) occurs in southern France, the Nikau (Rhopalostylis sapida) is a species of palm growing in New Zealand.	5376	Palm_tree	100	290
Most palms are a straight, unbranched stem, but sometimes a branching stem, or even a creeping vine, such as the rattan. (*) They have large evergreen leaves that are either 'fan-leaved' or 'feather-leaved' and arranged in a spiral at the top of the trunk. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side when it is grown. (*) The flowers grow on an inflorescence, a special branch just for carrying the great number of tiny flowers. The flowers are generally small and white, and are star-shaped. The sepals and petals usually number three each. The fruit is usually a single seed surrounded by flesh. The familiar coconut is the seed of a large fruit. (*) Some kinds may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.	5376	Palm_tree	100	747
Over two-thirds of palms live in tropical forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and other shorter palms form part of the understory. (*) Some kinds form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding. Other palms live on tropical mountains above 1000 meters, Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually where there is water, and in desert oases. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to very acidic soils. (*)	5376	Palm_tree	100	522
The Coco de mer has the largest seeds of any plant, 30-50 centimeters in diameter and weighing 15-30 kilograms each. Raffia palms, with leaves up to 25 meters long and 3 meters wide, have the largest leaves of any plant. The Corypha palms have the largest inflorescence (flowering part) of any plant, up to 7.5 meters tall and containing millions of small flowers. The wax palm, Colombia's national tree, is the tallest palm in the world, reaching heights of 70 meters. (*)	5376	Palm_tree	100	473
Like many other plants, some palms are in danger of dying out because of human activity. The greatest dangers are from Increasingly large cities, mining, and turning forests into farmland. The harvesting of heart of palm for food also poses a threat, because it comes from the inner core of the tree, and harvesting it kills the tree. The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a big fall in the number of rattan palms, as they are collected from the wild instead of being farmed. (*) The sale of wild seeds to growers and collectors is another threat.	5376	Palm_tree	100	557
It is very hard to save palm seeds because they are killed by cooling them, which is the normal way of keeping rare seeds for the future. Also, planting rare kinds in parks can never truly recreate the wild areas they come from, and the plants may not do well in these parks. (*)	5376	Palm_tree	100	279
The Palm Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) started in 1984, supported by the WWF. The group gathered a lot of information from different parts of the world. An action plan to save rare palms was made by this group in 1996. (*)	5376	Palm_tree	100	248
Human use of palms is as old as, or even older than, civilization itself, starting with the growing of date palms by Mesopotamians and other Middle Eastern peoples 5000 years or more ago.[1] The Date Palm had a great effect on the history of the Middle East. Historian W.H. Barreveld wrote:	5376	Palm_tree	100	290
"""Had the date palm not existed, the expansion of the human race into the hot and barren parts of the ""old"" world would have been much more restricted. The date palm not only provided a concentrated energy food, which could be easily stored and carried along on long journeys across the deserts, it also created a more amenable habitat for the people to live in by providing shade and protection from the desert winds. In addition, the date palm also yielded a variety of products for use in agricultural production and for domestic utensils, and practically all parts of the palm had a useful purpose"".[2]"	5376	Palm_tree	100	605
Apart from the well-known coconut and date, there are other kinds of food from palms. Palm oil, Sago, heart of palm and palm wine are all eaten or drunk in different parts of the world. Palm oil is used in everything, from cosmetics to food ingredients.	5376	Palm_tree	100	253
Coir is a coarse, water-resistant fibre from the outer shell of coconuts. It is used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes. 'Dragon's blood' is a resin used in dyes, varnishes and incense, can come from the fruit of the rattan. The Washingtonia robusta trees line Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California.	5376	Palm_tree	100	311
"In Christian art, martyrs were usually shown holding palms representing the victory of spirit over flesh, and it was widely believed that a picture of a palm on a tomb meant that a martyr was buried there. (*) Origen calls the palm ""the symbol of victory in that war waged by the spirit against the flesh. In this sense it was especially applicable to martyrs, the victors par excellence over the spiritual foes of mankind; hence the frequent occurrence in the Acts of the martyrs of such expressions as ""he received the palm of martyrdom""."	5376	Palm_tree	100	540
The sacred tree of the Assyrians was a palm that represents the god Ishtar connecting heaven, the crown of the tree, and earth, the base of the trunk. The Mesopotamian goddess Inanna, who had a part in the sacred marriage ritual, was thought of as the one who made the dates abundant. (*)	5376	Palm_tree	100	288
The Bill of Rights is the name for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, which limit the power of the federal government and guarantee citizens of the United States certain rights. The amendments were written in 1789 by James Madison, and were based on important ideas about personal rights. The Bill of Rights went into effect in 1791, when 3/4 of the states agreed that they were fair. Originally, the Bill of Rights had 13 different amendments, but the first two were not passed by enough states. The second amendment that was not passed was eventually added to the Constitution in 1992. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, and deals with pay changes for the government.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	709
This means that people can complain about things they do not like to the government. However, people do not have freedom to say things that will limit other people's rights. For example, people do not have the freedom to threaten to kill other people.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	251
"""No person shall be held to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger..."""	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	266
If somebody is accused of committing a very serious crime, including crimes that can be punished with the death penalty, they have the right to have a grand jury decide if there is enough evidence to give the person a trial. However, this does not apply to somebody who is accused of committing a crime while serving in the military.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	333
If somebody is accused of committing a crime and goes to a trial, and is found not guilty, the person cannot be forced to have a second trial. The idea of giving the same person a second trial after being found not guilty the first time is called double jeopardy.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	263
Somebody cannot be punished by being executed, going to jail or prison, or having money or property taken away from them without going through the legal system first. This could mean having a hearing, going before a judge, or having a jury trial.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	246
"""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law..."""	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	252
If somebody is accused of a crime, they have the right to a trial that does not take too long to start after the person is accused of the crime. The trial must be held in public and cannot be secret. The person has the right to have a jury who will decide the case fairly. Members of the jury cannot decide which side they will take before the trial starts. They also have the right to have their trial in the same area where the crime was committed.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	450
Somebody who is going on trial for a crime has the right to know why they are being accused of a crime and to ask questions to any witnesses who testify, or say in court, that the person committed the crime. A person that is going on trial has the right to have witnesses to the trial who say that the person did not commit the crime.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	334
"""In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."""	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	274
If somebody sues somebody over something that is worth at least $20, this is called a civil trial. They have the right of a jury trial. The decision of the jury is final, although in some rare cases, the judge can throw out the jury's decision and bring in a new jury if the judge thinks that the jury's decision ignored the facts that they learned during the trial.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	366
If somebody is arrested, they cannot be given too high of an amount for bail. Bail is something that people who are arrested have to pay if they want to be let out of jail before their trial starts. If they show up for their trial, they will get their money back.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	263
If the Constitution does not specifically say that the federal (United States) government has the power to do something, then the power to do it goes to the state government unless the Constitution specifically says that states can not do so.	5200	United_States_Bill_of_Rights	100	242
Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 - October 18, 1931) was an American inventor, who invented many things. Thomas Edison developed one of the first practical light bulbs, but contrary to popular belief did not invent the light bulb. Edison's 1093 patents were the most granted to any inventor in his time. (*)	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	312
Thomas Alva Edison was born in Milan, Ohio. When Edison was seven years old, he moved with his family to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison started school late because of an illness. Three months later, Edison was removed from school, because he could not pay attention to his teacher. His mother, who was a teacher in Canada, taught Edison at home. Edison's mother helped him become motivated for learning, and he was a good student to her.	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	435
"When Edison was twelve years old, he contracted scarlet fever. The effects of the fever, as well as getting picked up by the ears by a train conductor, caused Edison to become completely deaf in his left ear, and 80 percent deaf in the other. He learned Morse code of the telegraph, and began a job as a ""brass pounder"" (telegraph operator). At age sixteen, Edison invented his first invention, which was called an ""automatic repeater."" It sent telegraph signals between unmanned stations, allowing almost anyone to translate code easily and precisely at one's own speed and convenience."	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	587
"In 1868, Edison moved East and began to work for the Western Union Company in Boston, Massachusetts as a telegraph operator. He worked twelve hours a day, six days a week, and continued to ""moonlight"" on his own projects. Within six months, he had applied for and received his first patent for an electric vote recorder. It made the voting process faster but he couldn't find buyers. Then, Edison moved to New York and began to work for a company fixing their machines. At night, he continued to work on his projects."	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	517
In 1876 Edison used the money from his inventions to start his own laboratory in New Jersey. In 1877~78, he invented there the carbon microphone, which made the sound for Alexander Graham Bell's new telephone invention louder. In 1877, Edison invented the phonograph, the first machine that could record and play sound. The phonograph made him internationally famous. In 1879, Edison made a light bulb that lasted longer. Another invention, the electric power distribution network, lasted even longer. He liked chocolate.	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	521
He married Mary Stilwell in 1871. He had three children in that marriage: Marion Estelle Edison (also called Dot), Thomas Alva Edison, Jr. (also called Dash) and William Leslie Edison. Mary Stilwell died in 1884. Thomas Edison bought some land in Florida and built a house. When he was thirty-nine, Edison married Mina Miller, who was 19. He had 3 children in that marriage: Madeleine Edison, Charles Edison (who took over the company when his father died and was later elected Governor of New Jersey), and Theodore Miller Edison. He had a difficult life.	5392	Thomas_Edison	100	555
The first automobile was a wooden frame with three wheels, moved by a steam engine, with a steering mechanism and rudimentary brakes, and a bench to sit on: in 1769, French engineer Joseph Cugnot invented a fardier à vapeur (steam dray), a heavy cart intended to carry cannons. The front wheel, which was also the drive wheel, supported the weight of the boiler. It is said that on the first try, the fardier knocked down a wall. This invention arrived too early to be useful and the idea was left to rest for a century. However it was the direct ancestor of trucks, automobiles and even locomotives.	5150	Car	100	600
"In 1886, Carl Benz built his ""Patent-Motorwagen"", first automobile in history that moved with a reciprocating engine. Like modern cars, the Patent-Motorwagen had a piston engine, an electric ignition, a carburetor, a water radiator and a true chassis, made of steel."	5150	Car	100	266
In order to reduce costs and sell more, Henry Ford, established in Detroit (United States), inaugurated the assembly line with the Ford Model T, simple and robust, easy to fix, which would remain almost unchanged for almost two decades, from 1908 to 1927.	5150	Car	100	255
These cars with wooden artillery wheels were used up till the 1940s for field work in the American countryside, often turned into pickup trucks by a simple addition of a wooden box in the back. The motor was large (2.9 L capacity), consumed a lot (15 to 18 L of fuel for 100 km), but it didn't matter, since during that time, American petroleum was abundant. The car could reach speeds of 72 km/h.	5150	Car	100	397
Traction Citroën, starting production in 1934, has a number of innovations that are present in current cars unibody (no frame), aerodynamics and low height, overhead valve engine (top of the engine), FWD (front wheel drive), hydraulic brakes The Traction holds the road, goes faster, and consumes less. Depending on the version, it goes from 95 to 130 km/h Only the DS manages to dethrone it, starting in 1955	5150	Car	100	409
"Volkswagen (""People's Car"" in German) wants to be the car for everyone It was unveiled in 1936, but will not actually made ​​until 1948 With its two-door body, its rear engine air-cooled, its hard suspension and bad handling, it is the opposite of the Traction, but it will serve as a model for other small cars with rear engines, very popular until the 1960s, like the 4CV Renault Dauphine or the Simca 1000."	5150	Car	100	409
It was adopted the 20th of November, 1989 by the United Nations General Assembly. This assembly brings together the representatives of each member states of the United Nations. The Convention was then signed and ratified by most of the countries in the world. They promise thus one to every other to follow this text.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	317
The idea of a statement on the rights of the child which has the value of an international treaty had been present for several years but it was the Polish government who took the initiative of this work and proposed to the UN in 1978 the first version of the convention. Poland was the country of origin of Janusz Korczak (died in 1942), who had think over, put into practice and written about the rights of the child. The representatives from Poland who proposed the project quoted Korczak and were inspired by his work.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	521
"The year 1979 was declared the ""International Year of the Child"" by the UN that accepted and supported the project. Delegates of the voluntary countries formed a working group to prepare the agreement, the project is also followed by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and institutions under the UN such as UNICEF and the Commission on Human Rights. Starting on 1979 until the convention's adoption, the work group, whose expenses are paid by the ONU, had an office for secretarial work at Geneva in Switzerland and it met twice a year, gathering the delegates of about 40 countries in the world. It was necessary that the text was adapted and acceptable by very different countries, at the same time being useful and effective"	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	738
This work lasted 10 years. After the text has been modified and completed during this period, it was adopted November 20, 1989, exactly 30 years after the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The convention entered into force (became valid) on the 2nd September 1990, one month after 20 countries had already ratified it. It was signed and ratified quickly compared to the other conventions of the UN, and by a vast majority of the countries. Today all the countries of the world except three have signed and ratified it, sometimes with reservations on a particular article. Only the United States, Somalia and the South Sudan have not ratified it. The United States often delays signing treaties that they thinks possibly restrictive, but the intention to ratify the convention is still ongoing. Somalia is in a difficult political situation and South Sudan is a country which only obtained its independence in 2011.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	920
"The Convention concerning the Rights of Children contains of a ""preamble"" and 54 articles in three parts. The first 41 talk about the rights themselves, the 2nd part talks about their enactment and the necessary resources to check it while the 3rd part arranges its legal enactment: that is to say when the convention enters into force once signed and ratified by the countries (the word convention stands for agreement or treaty) and how it can be amended or rounded off."	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	472
The definition of child for the enforcement of the convention is stipulated in the first article: it is about every human beings under 18, unless the majority is attained earlier under the laws in effect in one country. Nevertheless, an infant and an older teenager being so different, several sections stipulate that they are applied on the basis of the age or maturity of the child.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	384
"These are the right to life, to a name and a nationality, the respect for the identity of the child. The right of non-separation between the child and parents is specified as follows: ""States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parent, or one where the parents are living separately and that a decision must be made as to the child place of residence."" Afterwards the article states the right of the child separated from one or both parents to maintain direct contact with them or see them regularly (article 9)."	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	886
Article 5 speaks of the rights and duties of the parents to guide and direct their child. This may be the role of the extended family or of the community depending on the customs and each situation. Article 14, regarding freedom of thought, conscience and religion, declares that children have these rights, and further adds that parents have the right and duty to guide the child in the exercise of these rights, in a manner consistent with his/her age and capacities. Articles 30 states that children of minorities who have their own religion, culture or language may not be deprived of it.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	592
Parents or the extended family have thus the right to transmit their identity, religion and culture to the child, while considering his liberty, in relation to his age. This makes that a state can not take children out of their families, communities or of the influence they have on this children, even if the representatives of this state declare that they aim to give them an education that they think is better. Actually, this occurred in several countries in the 20th Century.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	480
They are the rights of children to be protected against violence and maltreatment, including those with parental involvement, and to be protected from abandonment or negligence. Countries have to watch over so they can intervene in cases of maltreatment.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	254
On child labour, the Convention does not prohibit child labour at any age, but it states that children should be protected from economic exploitation and from work that is hazardous or that are bad for their development (Article 32). It requires also that countries have regulations concerning child labor (minimum age, limited hours...)	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	337
The article 37 and 40 establish several protections and guarantees in case of accusation of an offence or crime and in case of stay in prison. A child or teenager should not be arrested without valid reason. If he/she is suspected or convicted of an offence or a crime, he shall be informed quickly of what he is accused of, he shall be able to be helped to defend himself and be respected and protected, taking into account his age. His imprisonment should be the last solution. In prison he/she should be treated humanely and with dignity, he should be able to keep in touch with his family, to be helped, and that his case is handled fairly and without long delays if there must be a judgement. States must find laws and measures tailored to children suspected or convicted.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	777
Countries must reach a free and compulsory primary education for all, and that the secondary education, including general and vocational education (middle and high school levels) is open and accessible, as well as higher education (universities and equivalent), depending on the capacity of each.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	296
Article 17 says that countries must watch that the media (radio, television, newspapers, and now internet) is conveying suitable and useful information to children, especially cultural, which allows for an understanding of other cultures. They must protect children from information and material which may be injurious to their well-being, bearing in mind the freedom of expression and of information of the children.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	417
"The 31st article gives the right of the child to rest and to leisure: ""States Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts."""	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	279
Finally, a part of the convention is about the so-called participation rights, also called positive or political rights, that is to say, articles that give children, depending on their age, rights to express themselves and act as autonomous individuals. These rights are:	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	271
The right of expression of the child (article 12): on matters affecting the child for example, it is written that the views of the child shall be taken into consideration, in accordance with his/her age and maturity. Written like that, it does not mean that adults are forced to do everything that the child requests, but they do not have the right to ignore what it says about an issue that concerns him or not ask his opinion on an important issue. They can however, have their reasons for deciding otherwise.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	511
The freedom of expression and information (article 13): it's the right to express one's opinion, the right to seek, receive and impart (pass on) information. This right has limits: the rights and reputations of others or the risks for society.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	243
"The States shall comply with the convention and make sure it is fulfilled. In some case, they have or they had to pass new laws or change certain laws to comply with this commitment. For example, article 371 of the French Civil code on parental authority (child custody) was modified by a law of 2002 which added: ""Parents shall make their child party to decisions concerning him, according to his age and degree of maturity."" This comes from Article 12 of the Convention which is: ""States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child."""	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	747
The convention states that is enforcement must be followed and checked. The article 43 creates a group for that : the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It has 18 members, each elected for a four years term by the representatives of the countries. The costs of operating this committee are paid by the U.N., as well as the salaries of its members. The two following articles specify the functioning and role of this committee. They assemble three times a year in Geneva (January, May, and September) for three-week sessions each.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	532
"The States Parties (who have signed and ratified the convention) must present to the Committee of the Right of the Child every five years a report on the implementation of the rights stated by the Convention. These reports are read and studied and the committee responds to them through ""final observations."" The Committee works with other UN organisations or NGOs, and it is also in charge to inform as well as possible on the Rights of the Child."	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	448
The Convention was criticised on several points: some said it was too idealistic and could not effectively change the children difficulties in the poor countries. They also say that giving citizenship rights (speech ...) would be giving a responsibility that could be dangerous to children: the best way to grow would rather be that the children are all under adult guardianship including to form their ideas before being adults themselves. Some regret that the convention contains only rights and not duties.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	509
On the other side, the Convention was supported and waved by many people. They consider in one hand that it allow a better protection for children, and in the other hand that it fosters a benevolent change in the way children may be dealt with, for example by the fact that one should be considering their opinion on matters affecting them.	5110	Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child	100	340
The Middle Ages are a time period in European history that stretched from the end of the Western Roman Empire (in the 5th century) (*) to the start of the Renaissance and the time Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in 1492. (at the end of the 15th century).	5101	Middle_Ages	100	268
"The 'Middle Ages' are called this because it is the time between the fall of Imperial Rome and the beginning of the Early modern Europe. This period of time is also known as the Medieval Age, the Dark Ages, or the Age of Faith (because of the rise of Christianity). When used narrowly, the term ""Dark Ages"" refer only to very early period, from 476 to 800 (when Charlemagne became king)."	5101	Middle_Ages	100	387
Across Europe, the fall of the Roman Empire, after the invasions of different barbarian tribes, devastated towns and cities and their inhabitants. The Dark Ages are given this name because during this period of time Europe was in disarray, and it was not fun to live there and since few could write, little is known about it. Much of the knowledge that the Romans used (science, technology, medicine, and literature) was lost. The Dark Ages period was marked by mass migrations, wars and plagues. This lasted some 300 years until the development of feudalism partly diminished the continuous violence. Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in 800, and he promoted order, education and civilization. Europe began slowly regain what was lost during those centuries.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	757
Due to invasions and disorganized society, royal authority, too weak, was unable to properly protect the people. So the latter put themselves under the protection of a lord. In exchange, they worked for him, paying him taxes and giving him a portion of their harvests. This put in place a society divided between the owners of land (then the key to wealth) and those who worked it. Men were bound to each other by ties of loyalties granted more or less freely. Beginning in the 11th century, the development of towns allowed a new group (bourgeois artisans, merchants, and judicial and administrative officials) to gain importance, but at the same time, laborers in craft industries became more numerous.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	704
The attempted political unification of Europe by the Carolingians failed after the disintegration of the Frank empire in 843. While in the Germanic countries the Holy Roman Empire remained, to the west, very individualized countries progressively came into existence such as France and England. Dynastic kingdoms would compete for several centuries for these questions.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	369
The economy remained largely tied to agricultural production. Agriculture experienced significant change beginning in the 12th century, with practically none in the 10th century. The 14th century was a period of great difficulty in Europe; agriculture declined but remained dominant in the 15th century.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	303
Craft industry was embryonic in the cities at the beginning of the 11th century. But the urban growth that took off in the 12th century developed it. At the same time, major commerce resumed throughout continental Europe and the Mediterranean world. Wealthy merchants organized it.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	281
Society was organised into categories: those who worked (labourers), those who fought (warriors), and those who prayed (priests). The workers (farmers and artisans in the countrysides) represented over 90% of the European population. In the 10th century, they were subject to the authority of the warriors (the lords). Gradually, either through purchase or by force, they get their freedom (the freedom of urban immigration from the villages to the cities). The peasant world became more unequal, with the greater part of the population living in difficulty from day to day, while a tiny minority, the farmers, was able to play and important role in the campaigns. The warriors (the nobility's army) would levy taxes on the agricultural production and the individual farmers are put in difficulty by the endless conflicts of the 14th century and the 15th century. A new nobility, made up of royal administrators, appeared in the 15th century.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	942
Christians sought salvation of the soul above all else and feared the Last Judgment that would lead some to the eternal torment of Hell and others to eternal happiness in Paradise. For that, in the conduct of their ephemeral earthly life, they relied on the recommendations of the Church which were locally proclaimed by priests and popes. These monks were the gatekeepers for a population that can not read or write (except for a small minority), and can not have access to sacred books.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	488
The churches were responsible for education, but basic for the population. They were the only ones that could help the sick and the poor. The Catholic Church imposed the Peace of God to reduce the damage associated with wars between the lords.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	243
Efforts to reform the Catholic Church at the Council of Constance (1414-1418) failed. Believers proposed new ways to practice religion, such as John Wycliffe in England and Jan Hus in Bohemia (who was executed for this reason). Growing concern about salvation led some Catholics to question the validity of their religious beliefs and practices, particularly the heavy reliance on Works, on the veneration of saints and on spectacular expressions of penance. At the start of the 16th Century, this resulted in the birth of the Lutheran and Calvinist Churches, which separated from Rome.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	586
Intellectual and artistic life, weakened by the Germanic invasions of the fifth century, began again with the Carolingian Renaissance in the ninth century. Transfer of knowledge, largely controlled by the Catholic church, continued in monasteries and later in universities. After Carolingian art, Romanesque and Gothic art developed covering Europe in monuments testifying to the faith of the people.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	400
"The Late Middle Ages were the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, from 1300 to 1492. During this period the gun changed war and aristocracy and feudalism became less important. States founded standing armies. Before, armies were only formed when there was a war. States only made their laws, money and identity the same in the entire country. Technology, economy and science developed. Cities were founded and existing cities grew larger and richer. France and England fought the Hundred Years War. The Grand Duchy of Moscow regained its independence from the Mongols just like the Chinese, and under the name ""Russia"" became the most important state in Eastern Europe."	5101	Middle_Ages	100	672
In the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks conquered the Byzantine Empire. That event cut off the Silk Road, and the Europeans had to find new trade routes. In turn, the Muslims were driven off Spain. This event triggered the period called the Great Expeditions.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	258
In the late Middle Ages the Frisians rebelled against the Habsburgians from 1515 until 1523. They were lead into battle by the legendary warriors and warlords Donia and Jelckama. They were eventually defeated and decapitated (beheaded) in Leeuwarden.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	250
Meanwhile, the remains of Eastern Rome had become the Byzantine Empire, which was started by Roman emperor Constantine in 330, and likewise had a capital city named Constantinople. The Byzantine empire controlled Asia Minor, Southern Spain, Northern Africa and sometimes southern Italy but its lands were slowly eaten away by enemies like the Turks and the Franks. As a walled city on a peninsula the city of Constantinople was extremely difficult to attack. The Byzantines were eventually destroyed by the Ottoman Turks, who seized Constantinople in 1453. They called the city by its present-day name, Istanbul. This event is sometimes called the end of the Middle Age.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	670
Islam was founded in the early 7th century by the prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is God's ultimate revelation to mankind. Islam spread quickly along the major trade routes of the old world, finding appeal with traders and travellers.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	252
The Islamic religion soon split; between the Sunni Muslims and the Shi'a. The Sunni religion is the majority (roughly 85% of Muslims belong to this sect), whereas most Shi'a live in modern-day Iran and Iraq. The Sunni-Shi'a split has been compared to the Catholic-Eastern Orthodox split of the Christian church much later in 1054.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	330
Muslims quickly conquered the Christian countries of Iraq, Syria, Egypt, North Africa and Spain. The Christians were able to keep France and other European countries. Later Muslims took other countries such as Persia and India where they built the Mughal Empire. The Muslim Ottoman Empire eventually conquered parts of eastern Europe. The Muslims took hold of vast areas of land making them a superpower of the Middle Ages.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	423
Christianity in Europe confronted Islam in the Middle East during the Crusades, in the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista. From the fifteenth century, Christianity, had to face the conquering Ottoman Turks advancing to Europe and Central Balkan.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	251
During the Early Middle Ages, Muslims achieved what is remembered as a golden age of knowledge. During these times of strife in Europe, Muslim caliphs gathered the ancient texts of the great empires (Rome, Greece, Egypt) and attempted to re-integrate that knowledge. During this time a Persian Muslim helped develop progress in algebra. The golden age of Islam ended with the Turkoman invasions in the 11th century.	5101	Middle_Ages	100	415
Isaac Newton was born in 1643 (The same year Galileo Galilei died) in a manor house in Lincolnshire, England. His father had died three months before his birth. When Isaac was three his mother remarried, and Isaac remained with his grandmother. He was not interested in the family farm, so he was sent to the University of Cambridge to study.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	342
Isaac Newton explained the workings of the universe through mathematics. He described laws of motion and gravitation. These laws are math formulas that explain how objects move when a force acts on them. Isaac published his most famous book, Principia, in 1687 while he was a mathematics professor at Trinity College, Cambridge. In the Principia, Isaac explained three basic laws that govern the way objects move. He then described his idea, or theory, about gravity. Gravity is the force that causes things to fall down. If a pencil falls off a desk, it will land on the floor, not the ceiling. In his book Isaac also used his laws to show that the planets revolve around the suns in orbits that are oval, not round.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	717
The First Law states that an object that is not being pushed or pulled by some force will stay still, or will keep moving in a straight line at a steady speed. It is easy to understand that a bike will not move unless something pushes or pulls it. It is harder to understand that an object will continue to move without help. Think of the bike again. If someone is riding a bike and jumps off before the bike is stopped, what happens? The bike continues on until it falls over. The tendency of an object to remain still, or keep moving in a straight line at a steady speed is called inertia.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	591
The Second Law explains how a force acts on an object. An object accelerates in the direction the force is moving it. If someone gets on a bike and pushes the pedals forward the bike will begin to move. If someone gives the bike a push from behind, the bike will speed up. If the rider pushes back on the pedals the bike will slow down. If the rider turns the handlebars, the bike will change direction.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	403
The Third Law states that if an object is pushed or pulled, it will push or pull equally in the opposite direction. If someone lifts a heavy box, they use force to push it up. The box is heavy because it is producing an equal force downward on the lifter's arms. The weight is transferred through the lifter's legs to the floor. The floor presses upward with an equal force. If the floor pushed back with less force, the person lifting the box would fall through the floor. If it pushed back with more force the lifter would fly into the air.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	542
When most people think of Isaac Newton, they think of him sitting under an apple tree and apple falls on his head. When he saw the apple fall, Newton began to think about a specific kind of force — gravity. Newton understood that gravity was the force of attraction between two objects. He also understood that an object with more matter – mass - exerted the greater force, or pulled the smaller object toward it. That meant that the large mass of the earth pulled objects toward it. That is why the apple fell down instead of up, and why people don't float in the air. But this image of Isaac Newton never happened.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	616
Isaac Newton thought about gravity and the apple. He thought that maybe gravity was not just limited to the earth and the objects on it. What if gravity extended to the moon and beyond? Isaac calculated the force needed to keep the moon moving around the earth. Then he compared it with the force the made the apple fall downward. After allowing for the fact that the moon is much farther from the earth, and has a much greater mass, he discovered that the forces were the same. The moon is held in an orbit around earth by the pull of earth's gravity.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	552
Isaac Newton's calculations changed the way people understood the universe. No one had been able to explain why the planets stayed in their orbits. What held them up? Less than 50 years before Isaac Newton was born it was thought that the planets were held in place by an invisible shield. Isaac proved that they were held in place by the sun's gravity. He also showed that the force of gravity was affected by distance and by mass. He was not the first to understand that the orbit of a planet was not circular, but more elongated, like an oval. What he did was to explain how it worked.	5648	Isaac_Newton	100	588
Agriculture and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent (the Nile Valley, The Levant and Mesopotamia). (*) The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. Farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land.	4561	Farming	100	502
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like flowers, ornamental plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and nursery plants (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, animal hides (skins or furs), leather, industrial chemicals (starch, ethanol, and plastics), fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and flax), fuels (methane, biodiesel, biomass), and drugs (biopharmaceuticals, marijuana, opium)	4561	Farming	100	492
Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture, on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. When yields are low, forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.	4561	Farming	100	707
In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to eat more. This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times.	4561	Farming	100	1079
Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and nutritional value. They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease, more tolerant to drought, and easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).	4561	Farming	100	398
Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.	4561	Farming	100	285
Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include food security: to be sure there is enough food for everyone, enough income for the farmer to carry on with their profession and improvement of their skills and methods.	4561	Farming	100	306

"The Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or ""the Fertile Crescent"" was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf. Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia. Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit."	4251	Sumer	100	683
Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practising agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar. The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars	4251	Sumer	100	436
The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick.	4251	Sumer	100	298
Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame. The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top. The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today. Sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened. Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings. Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls. Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls.	4251	Sumer	100	672
The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the Ziggurat. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like pyramids, or wedding cakes. Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top. Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building. This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air. There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there, built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings.	4251	Sumer	100	791
Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs. We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess. They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud.	4251	Sumer	100	521
As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods.	4251	Sumer	100	356
Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people. Sheep and goats were probably more common. The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing or armor or tools.	4251	Sumer	100	388
The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and arm were left bare.	4251	Sumer	100	305
"Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of reed – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a stylus. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called Cuneiform, which means ""wedge-shaped""."	4251	Sumer	100	390
Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called scribes, were able to read and write. The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures. After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures.	4251	Sumer	100	546
Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes. They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well. Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees. They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city. The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra. After learning many words, scribes practised making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs. This made them fast and accurate scribes.	4251	Sumer	100	833
"Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60. So the number ""157"" would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157). Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not. Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and some astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar."	4251	Sumer	100	477
The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart. In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake. An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so. But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense. Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise.	4251	Sumer	100	416
Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air. Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat. The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last. Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans.	4251	Sumer	100	448
The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East.	4251	Sumer	100	364
The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains.	4251	Sumer	100	489
After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after. They had over 100 gods.	4251	Sumer	100	468
The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the Epic of Gilgamesh, a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality.	4251	Sumer	100	343
In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh. As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends. Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized. Both grow up to be very handsome.	4251	Sumer	100	656
Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree. Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest. Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree. Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree.	4251	Sumer	100	389
But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry. Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband. But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you. Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death. Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail.	4251	Sumer	100	562
Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it. But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies. Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend. He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils. Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself. His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it. He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal.	4251	Sumer	100	630
He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth. He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive. He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster. However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired. The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth. Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever. Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble.	4251	Sumer	100	783
The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days. Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat. No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise. Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman.	4251	Sumer	100	800
The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water. If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life. Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him. He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water. There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant. Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing. He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone.	4251	Sumer	100	813
Though Sumerians do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They may have been the first people to fit sails to boats. They made astronomical observations, and were also the first to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain.	4251	Sumer	100	813
Africa is a continent. It is the second largest continent in the world with an area of 30,272,922 km². It makes up about a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean (west), the Indian Ocean (east), the Red Sea (north-east) and the Mediterranean Sea (north).	416	Africa	100	281
It is the continent where the first humans evolved. Between the 7th and the 20th century, Slavery (Arab slave trade) and Atlantic slave trade) had depopulated Africa. In the middle of the 15th century, began the colonization of the African coasts by the Europeans (especially the Portuguese). In the middle of the 19th century european powers occupied much of the continent (especially United Kingdom and France). After World War II mostly of the countries got their independence.	416	Africa	100	480
Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources, such as springs are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) and farming surrounded by desert.	416	Africa	100	350
The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP.	416	Africa	100	376
Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state.	416	Africa	100	244
Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, (*) Sierra Leone, (*) Liberia, Sudan, (*) Zimbabwe, (*) and Côte d'Ivoire. (*)	416	Africa	100	265
Africa has a lot of wildlife. (*) (*) There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, leopard, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, Nile Crocodile, Hippopotamus, Lizard species, over 2341 bird species, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers. (*)	416	Africa	100	463
Ireland, official name Republic of Ireland, is a country of western Europe. Approximately four fifths of the area of Ireland island, one of the British Isles. It became independent from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1921, when the island was partitioned between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland which remained with the United Kingdom. Ireland is a member state of the European Union since 1973, and a member state of the Eurozone since 2002.	365	Ireland	100	474
Ireland was not conquered by the Romans. In the 5th century C.E. when Anglo-saxon conquered Britain, some of the British people took refuge in Ireland. English invasion began in the 12th century under Henri II. The Irish people, Celtic and Catholic, fiercely defended their independence. The whole of the island was conquered in the Tudors's times.	365	Ireland	100	348
In the 17th century, revolts against the English rule, led to English and Scottish families being settled on confiscated land, especially in the northern regions. In 1801, Union with Great Britain followed the unsuccessful rebellion of 1798. From 1801 until 1922 all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.	365	Ireland	100	338
In the 1840s by the failure of the potato crop millions died of starvation and millions emigrated, especially to the United States. In 1841, before the crisis, there were near 8.1 million inhabitants. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and partitioned from the south and stayed within the United Kingdom. The south became the Irish Free State. In 1937 a new constitution was adopted which named the state Ireland. In 1948 the Republic of Ireland Act declared Ireland to be a republic.	365	Ireland	100	486
Ireland is traditionally divided into four provinces and thirty-two counties. Twenty-six counties are in the Republic and six in Northern Ireland. Three of the provinces are entirely within the Republic (Connaught, Leinster, and Munster), and one province (Ulster) has some counties in both the Republic and in Northern Ireland.	365	Ireland	100	328
The main geographical features include low central plains surrounded by a ring of coastal mountains. The highest peak is Carrauntoohil, which is 1,041 metres (3,415 ft) above sea level (south-west of Ireland) The large central lowland is of limestone covered with glacial deposits of clay and sand, with many bogs and lakes. In the south, the mountains are composed of old red sandstone with limestone river valleys. In Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Down and Wicklow, the mountains are mainly granite Much of the northeast is a basalt plateau The main river in Ireland is the River Shannon, 386 km (240 mi), which separates the boggy midlands from the West of Ireland.	365	Ireland	100	661
A famous book named Topographia Hibernica, also known as Topographia Hiberniae, is a story of the landscape and people of Ireland written by Gerald of Wales around 1188. He wrote the book after the Norman invasion of Ireland. It was the biggest and most famous book about Ireland released during Middle Ages. The book named Topographia Hibernica directly influenced Ireland going into the Early Modern period.	365	Ireland	100	409
While both languages have official status, Gaeilge is the national and first official language of Ireland, followed by English. English is the predominantly spoken language of the country however, with Irish only being spoken most widespread in the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking areas), located for the most part in the west of the country. All students must study Irish as a core subject in their education from ages 5 to 18, meaning that most Irish people outside the native Irish-speaking communities have a certain level of knowledge in the language as well.	365	Ireland	100	558
The climate of Ireland is a temperate oceanic climate. It is mild, moist, and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. The Atlantic Ocean and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream affect weather patterns in Ireland.	365	Ireland	100	247
Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America. The Great Famine in the 1840s forced many to leave. It is estimated almost a million people died of starvation, and a million more emigrated. From a maximum of over eight million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over four million in the 1940s. Since then, the population has grown to over six million. Today, almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants.	365	Ireland	100	512
Walter Elias Disney (1905 - 1966) was an American cartoonist, moviemaker, screenwriter, actor, businessperson, and television presenter. He is famous for creating Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy, for producing the first full length cel animated movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. His live action movies include Old Yeller, Greyfriars Bobby, Pollyanna, Mary Poppins, and numerous others. He planned and built Disneyland in Anaheim, California.	2896	Walt_Disney	100	452
Austin is the state capital and fourth largest city (after Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas) in Texas, United States. In addition, it is the eleventh largest city in the United States. In 2013, the city proper had 885,400 people. (*) (*) (*)	4068	Austin,_Texas	100	241
A city is a place where many people live. There is no simple definition of how big a city can be. Some very large cities, such as Tokyo (Japan) and Mexico City (Mexico), have tens of millions of people. Many other cities may only have a few hundred people.	3046	City	100	256

English is one of the most spoken languages in the world. More than 500 million people speak English. It is the language natively spoken by most people in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. It is also an official language of India, the Philippines, Singapore, and many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa although not in the whole of United States, United Kingdom and Australia.	251	English_language	100	442

for a few hundred years. The language changed greatly, because it was mostly being spoken instead of written.

The Public Broadcasting Service, better known as PBS, is a broadcasting service based in Arlington, Virginia, USA. It is a not-for-profit service, meaning that its existence relies entirely on public donations. It does not show any commercials at all. The PBS is made up of a group of different broadcasters across the US, whose own programming contributes to PBS's output. There are more than 100 of these member stations, spread across all 50 states of the USA, as well as territories such as Guam and the Virgin Islands.	9518	PBS	100	523
PBS is known across the US for being responsible for the popularity of some of America's greatest celebrities, such as the chefs Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, the entertainer Fred Rogers and the artist Bob Ross. It was also the first station to nationally broadcast Sesame Street.	9518	PBS	100	281
A beach is a place near the ocean where people swim. A beach is mainly made of sand but also sometimes of pebbles. There is also a beach with rocks, there you can find rock pools: little puddles left in between the rocks from high tide. Many children like to make sand castles or other suctures made out of sand on the beach.	9457	Beach	100	325
The Winter is the season after autumn (fall) and before the spring. It is often associated with snow and cold temperatures. Winter officially begins on the winter solstice and ends on the vernal equinox. The time of year of winter is exactly opposite for the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.	2958	Winter	100	303
Like two other religions today, Judaism and Christianity, Islam is thought to be an Abrahamic religion, because the three religions are believed to have been started by Abraham. In all three religions, Abraham is one of God's earliest messengers. Islam is currently the second largest religion in the world with just above 1 billion followers. It is also the fastest growing religion in the world.	5664	Islam	100	397
Muslims, the people who follow the religion of Islam, pray in a holy place called the mosque. Most mosques have at least one dome and some have one or more towers. But a mosque does not need to have a dome or tower. Muslims take their shoes off before entering the mosque to pray. Prayer is one of the most important things that a Muslim does. The five most important things Muslims do in Islam are shown below.	5664	Islam	100	411
Fasting: Muslims fast during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic year. They do not eat or drink from sunrise till sunset for one lunar month. After Ramadan, there is a holiday called Eid al-Fitr (English: Festival of end-fast). Muslims usually have a party with families and friends and go to the mosque in the morning for a special oath service. (*)	5664	Islam	100	354
Hajj: During the Hajj season, Muslims go to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam, which is located in Saudi Arabia. Muslims must make the hajj at least once in their life if they can afford to do so. There is no need if a Muslim does not have the money to make the Hajj. At the end of Hajj season, there is a holiday called Eid al-Adha (English: Festival of Sacrifice). Muslims who have made the Hajj must buy a lamb to sacrifice and cook as food, if they have the money for it. Muslims believe that Abraham, one of God's earliest messengers, was told by God on the day of Eid al-Adha to sacrifice his son in Jerusalem. But the angel Gabriel congratulated Abraham's obedience to God and gave him a lamb instead. Muslims believe that in this time, God never allowed human beings to kill people in His name ever again.	5664	Islam	100	812
"In Arabic, the word Islam is a derivate of istislam wich means ""submission"". The word Islam comes from the Arabic word that means ""surrender."" By extension, Islam means specifically ""submission to Allah"". The way to submit to Allah is through worshipping him, obeying him, following the rules in the Qur'an, and trying to be like the prophet Muhammad. The Arabic word salaam also comes from the root meaning ""surrender"", although the word salaam actually means ""peace""."	5664	Islam	100	469
"The holy book in the religion of Islam is the Koran (also spelled Qur'an and Quran). Islam teaches that the Koran was given by Allah, or God, to the prophet Muhammad. They also teach that the Koran is in heaven and that it is a perfect book. Muslims show respect to the Koran by washing their hands before touching it, trying to memorize it, to follow what it says, and by getting rid of it in a different manner to normal books. The Koran has a total of 114 chapters, each starts with ""In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful."" (except only one). In each chapter there are also verses, going from 283 for the longest one to 3 for the shortest."	5664	Islam	100	655
"The Hadiths are sayings by the founder of Islam, Muhammad, in the purpose of teaching things in Islam that aren't defined in the Koran. There are the ""regular"" Hadiths, and the qudsi Hadiths, reported to be said by Allah himself (then relayed by Gabriel to Muhammad). Nevertheless, when citing a Hadith, it is recommended to ensure if it is truly said in Muhammad's era (Hadith sahih) or not. If true, the Hadith must be cited exactly as it was originally said, unless the person citing it tries to make it more understandable, while explaining that he's doing it, so that it isn't felt that he's trying to rewrite Islam."	5664	Islam	100	621
Pollution is when something is added to the environment that is harmful or poisonous to people, animals, and other living things. Smoke in the air from factories is a type of pollution as it is bad for the lungs when breathed in. Sewage in drinking water is another type of pollution, as it can make people unwell because it contains germs and viruses. People living next to a building site where there is too much noise can become sick as they cannot sleep or relax. This is called noise pollution.	5677	Pollution	100	499
Air pollution is caused by harmful gases such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide and very small particles of carbon. Most of the pollution is caused by factories, vehicles and livestock. Today air pollution has become a great threat to human life. People face breathing problems like asthma due to poll.	5677	Pollution	100	325
The harmful noise in the environment, such as the sound of cars in a city, loud speakers, etc. is called noise pollution. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. Noise pollution can be defined as the unwanted sound in the atmosphere.	5677	Pollution	100	288
Culture is a word for people's 'way of life', meaning the way groups do things. Different groups of people may have different cultures. A culture is passed on to the next generation by learning, whereas genetics are passed on by heredity. Culture is seen in people's writing, religion, music, clothes, cooking, and in what they do.	5681	Culture	100	331
Cultures are what make countries unique. Each country has different cultural activities and cultural rituals. Culture is more than just material goods, that is things the culture uses and produces. Culture is also the beliefs and values of the people in that country. Culture also includes the way people think about and understand the world and their own lives.	5681	Culture	100	362
Culture can also vary within a region, society or sub group. A workplace may have a specific culture that sets it apart from similar workplaces. A region of a country may have a different culture than the rest of the country. For example, Atlantic Canada has a different culture than the rest of Canada, which is expressed by different ways of talking, different types of music, and different types of dances.	5681	Culture	100	409
Companies or other organizations (groups of people) can have a separate culture. Japanese manufacturing companies often have a different culture to Western companies; the workday starts with exercise, and the workers are very loyal to the company.	5681	Culture	100	247
Companies in the high-technology sector often have a different culture than other companies. Software and computer companies sometimes allow employees to play games during the workday, or take time off work to relax, because these companies believe that this will help the workers to think better.	5681	Culture	100	297
Anthropology is studying human beings and how they relate to each other. An anthropologist is a person who studies anthropology. Anthropologists believe that people use symbols to communicate (express) their experiences—who they are, what they believe, where they started.	5681	Culture	100	272
"Anthropologists call this use of symbols ""culture"". For example, immigrants (people who move from one country to another) may keep some of their customs and traditions from their old country. By keeping their culture in this way, they express who they are and that they came from somewhere else."	5681	Culture	100	295
"Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production (factories, for example) are owned by corporations or individuals, not by a government or communities, and where people have to barter or work for money, so they can buy things they need or want, such as food. Capitalism mostly has a ""free market"" economy, which means people buy and sell things by their own judgment. In most countries in the world today the economy also has a degree of regulation, done by the government or by trade unions, so some argue that they should be called ""mixed economies"" instead of completely free markets. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea."	5683	Capitalism	100	702
"The word comes from ""capital"", meaning something of value. This can be money (""financial capital"") or any other goods that can be traded. ""Capital"" originally comes from the Latin word caput, meaning ""head"", because it was used to mean how many ""head"" of cattle a wealthy person owned, in days long ago when cattle were used as money. (In fact, the words ""capital"" and ""cattle"" both come from caput.)"	5683	Capitalism	100	400
In capitalism, people may sell or lend their property, and other people may buy or borrow them. If one person wants to buy, and another person wants to sell to them, they do not need to get permission from higher power. People can have a market (buying and selling with each other) without anyone else telling them to. What can be described as capitalism and the free market economy was introduced in by the philosopher Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations, although the word capitalist and capitalism was not introduced till the late 19th century.	5683	Capitalism	100	556
The word capital can be used to produce more things or money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools and machines are capital. If someone has money that can be invested, that is a capital too. People who own capital are sometimes called capitalists (people who support capitalism are called capitalists, too). They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories, shops or lands for them for the pay they offer.	5683	Capitalism	100	421
This is different from many older economic systems. In feudalism, most people were serfs and had to work for the people who owned the land they lived on. In mercantilism, the government makes it hard to buy things from other countries. In many countries with mixed economies (part capitalism and part socialism) there are laws about what you can buy or sell, or what prices you can charge, or whom you can hire or fire.	5683	Capitalism	100	419
An investment is when people invest (give) their money in things. People can put their money together to buy or build things, even if they are too big for one person to make alone. The people who invest get to be the owners of what they buy or build together. The stock market lets people buy and sell investments.	5683	Capitalism	100	314
People who start businesses, or invest in businesses, can make a lot of money. A business sells things that people want. The investors make extra money, which is called profit. Investors can take their profit and invest it in more businesses, or in making the business bigger. The investors can get more and more profit if the businesses are successful.	5683	Capitalism	100	353
"Socialists, anarchists, communists and what are referred to as ""quasi-socialists"" are people who do not support capitalism. They say it hurts workers, because businesses make more money by selling things than they pay to the workers who make the things and, therefore, businessmen become rich while workers remain poor and/or exploited. They also argue society would be more efficient if the individual was considerate of not only his/her interests, but the overall well being of society rather than competing against one another. Another argument is that each person has a right to minimal needs and within capitalism, sometimes people are not considerate of others or the environment in their quest for capital. The main difference between communists and spiritual communists is spiritual solidarity, as opposed to a materialist centered solidarity that most communists seek. (*)"	5683	Capitalism	100	881
Karl Marx was a famous communist philosopher from Germany. He wrote a famous book called The Capital (or Das Kapital in the German). He said that capitalism would go away after workers decided to take over the government in a revolution. There were violent communist revolutions, some of which caused civil wars, in many countries, and many people were killed because of this. But capitalism did not go away, and most of these Communist systems have collapsed and do not exist today, or else they have become more capitalist. Some people think that communism in those countries did not work because Marx's ideas, though nice in thought, did not really work. Others think that communist countries collapsed because of the attacks (military, political and economic) from capitalist countries.	5683	Capitalism	100	790
Anarchists (that are not anarcho-capitalists) do not support capitalism either. They do not think workers should take the government, but that there should be no government at all. They think that communism failed because the communists set up dictatorships that said that they would rule in the name of workers, instead of letting workers organize themselves freely.	5683	Capitalism	100	367
"There are different words for people who support capitalism. In many parts of the world, these people are called either conservatives or liberals (especially market liberals). But in the United States, the word ""liberal"" can mean someone whose beliefs lean toward social democracy; more or less what in other countries might be called social liberal. Libertarian is a word that in America and some other countries means someone who opposes the state, much like an anarchist, but is strongly in favor of capitalism."	5683	Capitalism	100	514
People who support capitalism also have disagreements. Most people agree that capitalism works better if the government keeps people from stealing other people's things. If people could steal anything, then nobody would want to buy anything.	5683	Capitalism	100	241
"In most countries, the government does more than that. It tries to make sure that people buy and sell fairly and that employment is fair. Because the government takes a lot of money in taxes, it also buys a lot of things and gives a lot of money away. It spends money on guns and ships for the military, on science research in universities, and on schools and libraries. It also gives money to people who do not have jobs, and to businesses that the political leaders think are important. Sometimes government gives money to people just because those people support the politicians who are in office. When the government is in charge of part of the economy, this is called a ""mixed economy."""	5683	Capitalism	100	691
"A few people think that people can protect themselves without any government. Instead of having laws against stealing, people could protect their own things, or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators, insurers, and private defenders to protect them. This belief is called ""anarcho-capitalism."" These people think that the government is a thief, because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves."	5683	Capitalism	100	468
The cell is the basic unit of structure of all organisms. The environment outside the cell is separated from the inside of the cell by the cell membrane. Inside some cells, parts of the cell stay separate from other parts by plasma membranes. These separate parts are called organelles (like small organs). They each do different things in the cell. Examples are the nucleus (where DNA is), and mitochondria (where usable energy is created). (*) (*)	5688	Cell	100	449
Eukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell. They are larger than prokaryote cells: they can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. Eukaryotes store their genetic information (DNA) on chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Organisms (living things) which are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes.	5688	Cell	100	338
The only kinds of prokaryotic organisms alive at present are bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotic organisms evolved before eukaryotic organisms, so at one point the world consisted of nothing but prokaryotic organisms. There are also viruses, which are hard to classify, but cause some important diseases. Viruses are made of RNA, or DNA, and protein, and they reproduce themselves inside the cells of bacteria or eukaryotes.	5688	Cell	100	422
Multicellular organisms are made from many cells. They are complex organisms. This can be a small number of cells, or millions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialized. This means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They live together, but cannot live alone.	5688	Cell	100	553
Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke (1635–1703). He used a compound microscope with two lenses to look at the structure of cork, and to look at leaves and some insects. He did this from about 1660, and reported it in his book Micrographica in 1665. He named cells after the Latin word cella, meaning room. He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms.	5688	Cell	100	369
Many other naturalists and philosophers tried out the new instrument. The structure of plants was investigated by Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). Grew's major work was The anatomy of plants (1682). (*) It is not clear who first saw animal cells, Malpighi, Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680) or Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723).p17	5688	Cell	100	354
Leeuwenhoek's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalules' opened up a whole new world for naturalists. Protozoa, and microorganisms generally were discovered, and the discoveries about them are still going on today. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's book Die Infusionsthierchen summarised what was known in 1838. Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) in 1805 wrote that infusoria (microscopic forms) were the basis of all life.	5688	Cell	100	415
"""The work of the Czech Jan Purkyně (1787–1869) and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory"".Chapter 9 Johannes Müller (1801–1858) also made great contributions. ""It was, however, his student Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) and Matthias Schleiden (1804–1881) who got the credit for the cell theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were ""a travesty"".p97"	5688	Cell	100	546
"Cuba is a country in the Caribbean Sea. The country is made up of one big island and many smaller islands. It is near the United States, Mexico, Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas. People from Cuba are called Cubans, and they speak Spanish. Cuba has a warm climate, but has many hurricanes every year. The capital city of Cuba is Havana. In Spanish, the capital is called ""La Habana""."	5689	Cuba	100	380
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards,three tribes lived on the island were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them.	5689	Cuba	100	794
The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of sugar. In the 19th century, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent republic in 1902. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the Platt Amendment. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba's businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.	5689	Cuba	100	695
In 1959, Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista. Castro took power of Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina, his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans also went to America because of this. In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America, after the U.S put nuclear weapons in Turkey. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviet Union then removed the missiles.	5689	Cuba	100	884
Cuba became a socialist country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba's sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba's schools and hospitals some of the best in the world, and the army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.	5689	Cuba	100	448
In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government over the economy, non-communist parties were allowed to operate in Cuba, and the government allowed small businesses to be created. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.	5689	Cuba	100	665
In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though Fidel Castro had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro is 80 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state. In 2008, Raúl Castro became the official president of Cuba, and in 2019, Miguel Diaz-Canel become the President. In 2016, Fidel Castro died.	5689	Cuba	100	398
Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops.	5689	Cuba	100	295
Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the sugar cane. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop growin in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is Tobacco. Tobacco is made into cigars by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world. (*) Other important crops are rice, coffee, and fruit. Cuba also has many minerals. Cobalt, nickel, iron, coopper, and manganese are all on the island. Salt, petroleum, and natural gas are there too. The coast of Cuba has many bays and a few good harbors. Havana, which is the capital, is also a port. Other harbors have port cities. Nuevitas is a port city on the north coast. Cienfuegos, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast.	5689	Cuba	100	790
Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot, despite its being in the tropiocal zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, most of Cuba's port cities can be flooded along the coast.	5689	Cuba	100	404
The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the Spanish settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. The socialist government guarantees the people the right to a basic education. All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old, and nearly everybody are able to read and write at least.	5689	Cuba	100	592
Fidel Castro was a very important man in Cuba. There were pictures of him all over the country, and his speeches were often printed in the newspapers and broadcast on television or radio. Because of Castro, many times soldiers have been sent to other countries to support communist and anti-imperialist rebels. Cuban soldiers have fought against anti-communist groups in Angola, Ethiopia, and Nicaragua. But after the fall of socialism in Europe, Russia has stopped paying for these soldiers, and almost all of them came home.	5689	Cuba	100	526
"Judaism is the world's oldest Abrahamic religion. There are about 15 million followers who are called Jews. (*) It is one of the oldest monotheistic religions, teaching the belief in one God. Both Christianity and Islam have similarities with Judaism. These religions accept the belief in one God and the moral teachings of the Hebrew Bible, which includes the Torah or ""תורה."""	5693	Judaism	100	377
"The Torah is the most important holy book of Judaism. The Hebrew Bible is a collection of writings called the ""Tanakh"" (תנ”ך) in Hebrew. It is divided into three parts - Torah (תורה, Instruction), Nevi'im (נְבִיאִים, Prophets), and Ketuvim (כְּתוּבִים, Writings)."	5693	Judaism	100	263
The most important teaching of Judaism is that there is one God, who wants people to do what is just and compassionate. Judaism teaches that a person serves God by studying the holy writings and doing what they teach. These teachings include both ritual practices and ethical laws. Judaism teaches that all people are created in the image of God and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.	5693	Judaism	100	397
"The covenant with God is an agreement that Jews believe God made with Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish people. According to the Bible, God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshipped God and were faithful to Him. God made this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac, and Isaac's son, Jacob. Jacob was also called Israel, and so his descendants were known as the ""Children of Israel"" or the Israelites. God later gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws through their leader, Moses. These laws told the Israelites how to live their lives and build their community."	5693	Judaism	100	598
"The Jews are sometimes called the ""Chosen People"", meaning that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God. For example, the Jews must establish a just society and serve only God. Thus, the covenant assures the Jews of God's love and protection, but it also makes them accountable for their sins and shortcomings."	5693	Judaism	100	333
"Jews believe that God will send a Messiah to save them. The word Messiah comes from the Hebrew word mashiah, which means ""the anointed one"". The Book of Isaiah describes the Messiah as a just ruler who will unite the Jewish people and lead them in God's way. The Messiah will fix wrongs and defeat the enemies of the people. The Messiah will unite all the people of the world to serve God. People will act just as kind, and the whole world will be filled with peace."	5693	Judaism	100	466
The two most important groups of books in Judaism are the Bible and the Talmud. The beliefs and rituals of Judaism come from these books. Later, Jewish teachers and scholars wrote more books, called commentaries, which explain and say more about the teachings of the Bible and Talmud.	5693	Judaism	100	284
The Torah is the most important of all Jewish writings. The first five books of the Hebrew Bible make up the Torah. The Torah contains the basic laws of Judaism and describes the history of the Jews until the death of Moses. Jewish tradition says that God told Moses what to write in the Torah, which is also called the Five Books of Moses.	5693	Judaism	100	340
Jews divide the Bible into three parts and call it the Tanakh. The three parts are the Torah, which is the first five books; the Nevi'im, which are the books of the prophets; and the Ketuvim, meaning the Writings, which are other books of history and moral teachings.	5693	Judaism	100	267
There are various important actions in Judaism. These are called mitzvot. A mitzvah is a commandment (law, rule) from God to the Jewish people. The word mitzvah means commandment in Hebrew, but, perhaps based on common Yiddish usage, many people think of a mitzvah as 'a good deed,' or 'a good thing to do.' Traditionally, Jews believe that the Torah specifies mitzvot for all people; all of mankind must keep seven laws, as taught to Noah and his children after the flood. The Jews must keep 613 mitzvot, which are listed in the Torah. Some mitzvot are for everyday life, and some are observed only at special times, such as on Jewish holidays. Many of these 613 commandments relate to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and therefore cannot be done since the Temple was destroyed. (*)	5693	Judaism	100	780
Religious Jews believe that Moses brought the Ten Commandments and the Torah down from Mount Sinai. Rabbinic Jews also believe that there is another part of the Torah besides the 5 books of Moses. It is called the Mishnah, also called the Oral Torah or Oral Law. It explains how to follow the laws written in the 5 books. There is a commentary (explanation) of the Mishnah, called the Gemara. Together, the Mishna and the Gemara make up the Talmud. Karaite Jews, however, believe that there is no additional Torah besides the 5 books of Moses.	5693	Judaism	100	543
Traditional Jews believe that God gave the written Torah and the oral Torah to Moses and that Moses told it to the Jewish people, and that it is the same today as it was back then. Traditional Jews also believe that all of the Commandments must still be followed today.	5693	Judaism	100	269
It is considered good in Judaism to talk about the Commandments and to try to understand how to follow them. The Talmud has many stories about Rabbis who argued about the Commandments. Over time, some opinions have become the rule for everyone. Some rules are still being argued about. Jews praise logical argument and looking for truth.	5693	Judaism	100	337
Religious Jews follow special rules on Shabbat. These rules require Jews not to do creative work on Shabbat. One reason for this is to give people a break from all the things that make them busy during the week. This helps them focus more on appreciating God, their family, and the rest of creation. Also it reminds people that God is the creator and ruler of the world; and no matter how great a person's creative power is, it cannot compare with God's creation of the universe and everything in it. Many of these categories of creative work include actions that people might not think of as work. For instance, on Shabbat a Jew cannot:	5693	Judaism	100	637
Traditional Jews are very careful about Shabbat. It is a special day. They clean their houses and prepare special food for Shabbat. They dress in their nicest clothes. They sing beautiful songs and say extra prayers in the synagogue. They have dinner and lunch with their families. Many families also invite guests for dinner and for lunch. They eat special delicious food and sing together traditional Shabbat songs. On Shabbat afternoon people study Judaism together or just visit friends.	5693	Judaism	100	491
Traditional Jews are very careful about kashrut. They usually cannot eat many foods in non-kosher restaurants or in the home of someone who does not keep kosher. Sometimes, this makes it hard to visit people or to do business. It is important to understand that this is part of their religion. People help avoid this problem by choosing to dine with Traditional Jews in a kosher restaurant or serve them kosher food in their home.	5693	Judaism	100	430
"Foods sold in stores or restaurants must be checked by a Jew who is an expert in Kashrut. The name for this person is ""mashgiach,"" or kosher overseer. He makes sure that the kosher rules were kept. Foods bought at the store often have a symbol called a hechsher on them to tell the customer that the food has been checked. Many everyday foods have a hechsher."	5693	Judaism	100	359
A Jew cannot eat a meal that has both meat and milk in it. This comes from the rule (in the Torah) that a Jew must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk. Because of this, Jews use separate dishes and utensils for foods that have meat in it, and foods that have milk in it.	5693	Judaism	100	277
Pidyon haben (for boys) is when a father does a special ceremony to redeem his wife's first son from the Temple, as originally all firstborn boys were sent to serve in the Temple. Levites (a tribe of Israel) and Cohanim (priests) do not do this ritual.	5693	Judaism	100	252
"Bat Mitzvah (for girls) a 'coming of age' ceremony when a girl turns 12 (13 for some Jews). Bat Mitzvah means ""daughter of the mitvah"" or ""daughter of the commandments"" in Hebrew. Once a girl turns 12 (or 13), she is considered a woman and is expected to follow Jewish law. A ceremony is not required. Bat Mitzvah not only refers to the ceremony but also to the girl herself."	5693	Judaism	100	375
"Bar Mitzvah (for boys) a 'coming of age' ceremony when a boy turns 13. It includes reading the Torah and special prayers. Bar Mitzvah means ""son of the mitzvah"" or ""son of the commandments"" in Hebrew. Once a boy turns 13, he is considered a man and is expected to follow Jewish law. A ceremony is not required. Bar Mitzvah not only refers to the ceremony but also to the boy himself."	5693	Judaism	100	383
"For a very long time, most Jews in Europe believed the same basic things about Judaism. Jews in other lands had different beliefs and customs than European Jews. About 200 years ago, a small group of Jews in Germany decided to stop believing in many parts of Judaism and try to become more ""modern"" and more like Germans. Those Jews were called Reform Jews."	5693	Judaism	100	357
Today there are three main kinds of Judaism: Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism. There are also kinds with a smaller number of people, such as Reconstructionist Judaism, and Karaite Judaism, Each group has its own practices according to how it understands the Jewish laws. Some do not believe in keeping most of the laws. For example: Reform (also called Liberal or Progressive) Judaism does not require eating kosher food or keeping the Sabbath at all. Reform Judaism teaches Jews to focus on the ethical laws of Judaism. Conservative Judaism developed after Reform Judaism. The leaders of Conservative Judaism felt that Reform Judaism was too radical. They wanted to conserve (protect) Jewish tradition instead of reforming (changing) it. Orthodox Jews are not convinced that Reform and Conservative Judaism are correct because they believe that the laws given by God are timeless, and can't be changed.	5693	Judaism	100	913
In the most recent survey of Jews in the United States in 2000-2001, it was found that 35% of American Jews say they are Reform, 27% say they are Conservative, 10% say they are Orthodox, 2% say they are Reconstructionist and 25% do not say what type they are.	5693	Judaism	100	259
"In Israel, almost all Jews go to Orthodox synagogues. There are very few Reform or Conservative synagogues, but there has been a steady increase since 2009. In Israel, Jews do not call themselves Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox. Instead, they mostly call themselves ""Haredi"" (completely religious) ""Dati"" (basically religious), ""Masorati"" (traditional/conservative) or ""Chiloni"" (secular). Surveys suggest that about 20% of Israelis say they are secular, 25% say they are Dati or Haredi and 55% say they are traditional."	5693	Judaism	100	522
"Names are very important in Judaism. Many Jews believe that a name not only tells you who someone is but also tells you something about them. Names of God are very special in Judaism, so Jews do not write them or speak them fully but use other words instead. That is why some Jews write G-d, with a ""-"" instead of an ""o."""	5693	Judaism	100	321
"God - Some Jews write ""God"" by replacing the ""o"" with a dash, like this: ""G-d"". They do this because God's name is very holy so they are not allowed to throw away a piece of paper with ""God"" written on it. However, if by accident ""God"" is written, then the paper can be disposed of in a special way and buried in a special place. Others say that ""God"" is just an English word, not Hebrew, and so it is not holy."	5693	Judaism	100	411
"YHWH (""Yehovah"") is the most sacred name of God in Hebrew and is not pronounced by most Jews. No one knows where the name came from, or what exactly it means. It looks like the Hebrew word ""hayah,"" which is the verb ""to be."" (According to Hebrew scripture, when Moses asked God who God was, God told Moses I am that I am.) Jews believe that the name YHWH shows that God is endless. Instead of trying to say it, most Jews say ""haShem"", which means ""The Name."" Some people pronounce this name as Yahweh, or Jehovah. Scholars of religion sometimes refer to ""YHWH"" as the Tetragrammaton, from Greek words meaning ""four letters""."	5693	Judaism	100	624
"The Jewish scriptures say that Judaism began with a man named Abram who lived in the city of Ur. According to the Midrash, Abram strongly believed that the people in Ur were wrong to pray to different gods and statues. He believed that there was really only one god who was not a statue. The Torah tells that God spoke to Abram and told him to leave Ur with his family and move to Canaan, where he started a new religion. God told him that his name would be changed to Abraham. The Midrash also says that angels taught Abraham a new holy language, which Jews believe is the language today known as Hebrew. Hebrew continues to be the language of Judaism. Abraham's grandson Jacob is said to be the one who first had the name of ""Israel""."	5693	Judaism	100	736
"According to the Torah, at one time, the Hebrew people moved to Egypt because of famine in Canaan. The 12 tribes sold everything that they had to Egypt because Pharaoh had what Israel lacked. In the end, they sold themselves into slavery. Pharaoh agreed and eventually the famine ended, but the tribes were bound to slavery. Later God told Moses that he (Moses) would be an ambassador to God and plead the case to free the 12 tribes of Israel. Pharaoh said ""No"" time and again and each time he did God sent many terrible punishments to the Egyptians to make him to free the Hebrews. Finally, the Pharaoh let the Hebrews go free but then decided to send the Egyptian army after them. The Hebrews escaped when God made the waters of the Red Sea open a path for them. The waters then returned and drowned the Egyptian army. The Torah says that after this, Moses met with God on Mount Sinai and received the Ten Commandments and the Torah from God."	5693	Judaism	100	944
Later this country broke apart into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah. Israel was conquered by Assyria in the 8th century BC, and the people were taken away. Later Judah was conquered by Babylonia in the early 6th century BC, and its people were taken captive to Babylon. They were allowed to go back to Judah again when Babylon was conquered by Persia. Some Jewish people stayed in Babylon (now Iraq) and others also lived in other countries.	5693	Judaism	100	440
By 50 BC, Judah (then called Judea) was ruled by the Roman Empire. During this time, the main language of Judea was Aramaic. The Jews did not like the Roman government or customs and often made trouble for the Romans. In 70 AD, after a revolt against the government by the Jewish community, the Romans destroyed Judea's capital city, Jerusalem and sent almost all Jews into exile.	5693	Judaism	100	380
"After this, the Jewish people did not have their own country. They were a small minority in almost every place they lived. This time is called the Diaspora when Jews spread around the world. They lived in many other countries. Jews living in Spain and Portugal used the language Ladino (also called Judeo-Spanish). Jews living in Germany, Poland, and Russia used the language Yiddish. Jews living in North Africa spoke Judeo-Arabic or Haketia, the local name for Ladino. Jews have lived in most, but not all, places in the world, including India, China, Yemen, and Ethiopia. Even today, Jews who do not live in Israel are often said to live ""in the Diaspora"". In some places, like India, Jews lived without any problems. In other places, like most of Europe and Islamic countries, there was bigotry or even hatred against Jews and they lived under unfair laws. Sometimes Jews suffered from outright persecution (that is: systematic hatred and violence), sometimes they were forced to dress in special, ugly clothes, pay higher taxes than others, not build higher houses than others, not to ride a horse or donkey, wear certain badges etc. But Jews were known as skillful bankers. In Europe, where the Roman Catholic church forbade Christians from lending money against interest, Jews worked as bankers and money-lenders."	5693	Judaism	100	1320
One nomad nation, the Khazars, converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The Khazar khanate, which was in the modern Ukraine and Belarus, was the only independent Jewish state before the modern day Israel. The Khazar state was destroyed by the Eastern Vikings (Rus) in 987.	5693	Judaism	100	272
"The Jewish People have always believed that they have a special mission from God. They do things in their own ways, such as having special rules about food and eating, not working on the Shabbat, keeping their own holidays, and not marrying people from other religions. Because of this, people in many different times and countries have thought that the Jews were strange and may be dangerous. Many countries made laws that the Jews could not work in some jobs or live in some places. Sometimes Jewish people were killed because of their religion. The word ""antisemitism"" describes the hatred for Jews."	5693	Judaism	100	602
During the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi (National Socialist) government of Germany conquered most of Europe. They did terrible things to the Jewish people because they claimed the Jews were responsible for the problems in Germany during and after the First World War. The Nazi government killed more than six million Jewish people. Before they were killed, often in gas chambers, many of the Jews were made to be forced workers, and some of them were forced to help in the killing and capturing of the others.	5693	Judaism	100	506
In 1948 after World War II, the United Nations made the country of Israel for the Jews in Palestine, which is in the same place as the original Israel, in the Middle East. The land had been part of the Ottoman Empire before World War I. Then Britain controlled the area under the oversight of the United Nations. Many Jews moved back to Israel, then called Palestine, starting in the late 1800s. When the country of Israel was made in 1948, there were about 600,000 Jews in it. Today there are about 5,600,000 Jews in it.	5693	Judaism	100	521
Jewish history continues today in both Israel and the Diaspora. Outside of Israel, there are many Jews in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, France, Russia, Ukraine, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. There are smaller numbers of Jews living in other parts of the world.	5693	Judaism	100	299
Iraq has been known by the Greek name Mesopotamia which means (Land between the rivers) and has been home to continuous successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. Iraq was part of several empires, some were Safavid, and Afsharid. Most Iraqis are Shia Muslims.	5697	Iraq	100	403
In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Pakistan, and others fought to free Kuwait. Later, some agents believed to be sent by Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George H. W. Bush with a truck bomb in Kuwait.	5697	Iraq	100	298
"In March 2003, an invasion led by American, British, Australian, Danish and Polish forces forced the Ba'ath Party to surrender. The publicly stated reason for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein refused to let United Nations inspectors look for suspected nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In the past, Iraq used chemical weapons to kill people. Iraq used chemical gas on some Kurdish villages such as ""Halabja"" and killed five thousand Kurds in the north of Iraq. Iraq had done research in making biological and nuclear weapons."	5697	Iraq	100	538
The country was initially split into 3 zones, the American zone, the British zone, and the Polish zone similar to the way Germany was divided in 1945. Forces from Denmark controlled areas in the British zone. A new temporary government was formed on June 28, 2004. The coalition forces were in the country.	5697	Iraq	100	306
There were many U.S., British and multi-national troops in the country until December 15, 2011 when the Iraq War had ended. Tensions between religious groups (Shia and Sunni Muslims, as well as Christians) lead to a great deal of instability in the country.	5697	Iraq	100	257
The country area lies between two rivers; for this reason the area was called Mesopotamia in ancient ages. The rivers Euphrates and Tigris bound what is called the Fertile Crescent. Iraq also has a small coastline along the Persian Gulf, and this coastline was considered the heart of the petroleum trade in Iraq before the First Gulf War. The weather is extremely hot and dry because Iraq is far from seas and oceans and even the close ones are blocked by mountains so that the rainy wind can not reach the inlands. This region has fertile land because of the two rivers.	5697	Iraq	100	572
"Iraq has a large amount of oil. Iraq is the world's number four in petroleum production and the world's number two in petroleum reserves. In the past, Iraq sold much of this oil to other countries. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United Nations stopped Iraq from selling the oil. The United Nations later allowed Iraq to sell some oil to buy food, clothes, and medicine so the people would not suffer as much. This was called the ""Oil-for-Food"" program."	5697	Iraq	100	467
"The samurai (or bushi) were Japanese warriors. The word samurai comes from the Japanese Verb saburai, which means to serve (someone). In the past, there were many different Classes of people in Japan. ""Samurai"" were members of the important Military Class before Japanese society changed in 1868."	4500	Samurai	100	296
During the chaotic Era of Warring States (sengoku jidai, 1467-1573), Japan was made up of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other. This is why the country needed lots of samurai. Between the wars, many samurai were working on farms. Many of the famous samurai movies by Akira Kurosawa take place during this era.	4500	Samurai	100	343
In the Twelfth Century, two military clans named the Minamoto and Taira had become very powerful. These clans controlled much of Japan. The Minamoto and Taira clans also fought wars against each other. The Minamoto Yoritomo started a new government in Kamakura in 1192. As shogun, the highest military officer, he became the ruler of Japan.	4500	Samurai	100	340
Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536 or 1537-1598) won many wars against other clans. When he reunited Japan, Hideyoshi developed a very strict social caste system. It was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and the rulers after him. Between the wars, many samurai had always worked on farms. Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns. Furthermore, he made it a law that the samurai were the only people who were allowed to arm themselves with a sword.	4500	Samurai	100	498
"In the Edo period (1603-1867), the samurai were the most important social Caste, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants. All samurai had to live in Castle towns. The samurais' Lords paid them with rice. Some samurai did not have Lords. These samurai were called ""ronin"". The ""ronin"" caused some problems for Japan in the early Edo period."	4500	Samurai	100	347
In 1615, Tokugawa won an important battle when he took Osaka Castle. The Tokugawa clan did not have any more Rivals. Japan became very peaceful for about 250 years. In these 250 years, military skills became less important. Most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.	4500	Samurai	100	277
"Japanese swords are the weapons that most people connect with samurai. Ancient Japanese swords from the Nara period (Chokutō) featured a straight blade, by the late 900s curved tachi appeared, followed by the uchigatana and ultimately the katana. Smaller commonly known companion swords are the wakizashi and the tantō. (*) Wearing a long sword (katana) or (tachi) together with a smaller sword such as a wakizashi or tantō became the symbol of the samurai, this combination of swords is referred to as a daishō (literally ""big and small""). During the Edo period only samurai were allowed to wear a daisho."	4500	Samurai	100	606
"The yumi (longbow) was a major weapon of the Japanese military. Use of the Yumi became less common when samurai began to use the ""tanegashima"" (Japanese matchlock) in the Sengoku period. But many samurai continued to use the Yumi for sport. (*) The yumi was an uneven composite bow made from bamboo, wood, rattan and leather. A yumi could hit a target 50 or 100 meters away. or 100 meters away. On foot, it was usually used behind a tate (手盾), a large, mobile wooden shield, but the yumi could also be used from horseback because of its asymmetric shape. The practice of shooting from horseback became a Shinto ceremony known as yabusame (流鏑馬). (*)"	4500	Samurai	100	648
"Pole weapons including the yari and naginata were commonly used by the samurai. The yari (Japanese spear) displaced the naginata from the battlefield as personal bravery became less of a factor and battles became more organized around massed, inexpensive foot troops (ashigaru). A charge, mounted or dismounted, was also more effective when using a spear rather than a sword, as it offered better than even odds against a samurai using a sword. In the Battle of Shizugatake where Shibata Katsuie was defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then known as Hashiba Hideyoshi, seven samurai who came to be known as the ""Seven Spears of Shizugatake"" (賤ヶ岳七本槍) played a crucial role in the victory. (*)"	4500	Samurai	100	687
Tanegashima (Japanese matchlock) were introduced to Japan in the 1543 through Portuguese trade. Tanegashima were produced on a large scale by Japanese gunsmiths, enabling warlords to raise and train armies from masses of peasants. The new weapons were highly effective, their ease of use and deadly effectiveness led to the tanegashima becoming the weapon of choice over the yumi (bow). By the end of the 16th century, there were more firearms in Japan than in many European nations. Tanegashima—employed en masse, largely by ashigaru peasant foot troops—were responsible for a change in military tactics that eventually led to establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate (Edo period) and an end to civil war. Production of tanegashima declined sharply as there was no need for massive amounts of firearms. During the Edo period, tanegashima were stored away, and used mainly for hunting and target practice. Foreign intervention in the 1800s renewed interest in firearms—but the tanegashima was outdated by then, and various samurai factions purchased more modern firearms from European sources.	4500	Samurai	100	1092
"Cannons became a common part of the samurai's armory in the 1570s. They often were mounted in castles or on ships, being used more as anti-personnel weapons than against castle walls or the like, though in the siege of Nagashino castle (1575) a cannon was used to good effect against an enemy siegetower. The first popular cannon in Japan were swivel-breech loaders nicknamed kunikuzushi or ""province destroyers"". Kunikuzushi weighed 120 kg and used 18 kg chambers, firing a small shot of 280 g. The Arima clan of Kyushu used guns like this at the Battle of Okinawate against the Ryūzōji clan. By the time of the Osaka campaign (1614–1615), cannon technology had improved in Japan to the point where at Osaka, Ii Naotaka managed to fire an 8.2 kg. shot into the castle's keep."	4500	Samurai	100	776
"Samurai were allowed to fight anyone who did not show them proper respect. Every sword had to be tested; to do this, the owner of the sword could execute a criminal. This allowed the warrior to test his sword's sharpness. Samurai led their lives according to the ethic code of bushido, which translates as ""the way of the warrior"". This signifies loyalty to one's master, self-discipline and respectful, ethical behaviour from visitors to enemies on the battlefield. When a samurai lost his master, also called Daimyo, he became a Ronin."	4500	Samurai	100	537
"After a defeat or the samurai dishonored himself by not following the code of bushido, the samurai must commit ritual suicide, which is called Seppuku. To a samurai, death was better than having no honour. In Seppuku, samurai cut their stomach before the enemy could capture them, in the case of a war. In Europe, this ritual is often mistaken for hara-kiri. Hara-kiri means ""to cut the stomach"". In other words, hara-kiri refers only to the action done by Seppuku and not the whole ritual. Seppuku was thought to be a more honourable death for a samurai than being captured by the enemy. Another reason to commit Seppuku was the death of the Daimyo. With this ritual, a samurai was able to show how loyal he was to his dead master. There were periods when Seppuku was forbidden, but there were still samurai who committed it."	4500	Samurai	100	826
Japanese women had a very clear role in Japanese society. Most of them took care of house and crops and raising children. There were a few women who were samurai. One of the most famous Japanese samurai women was Itagaki. She lived during the end of the Heian period (794 – 1192) and owned her own army of about 3000 warriors. In 1199, Itagaki fought against 10.000 Heike soldiers. She was very good at handling the naginata sword, which made her very famous.	4500	Samurai	100	459
"Samurai women were also trained to defend themselves and their children. They usually did this while their warrior husbands were busy in battles. The samurai wife was called okusan (in translation ""one who remains at home""). This is why samurai women were trained to handle polearms (naginata) and short daggers (Tanto). During the Edo period (1600-1800 AD), Japanese women were trained to handle naginata by the age of 18. The short kaiken knife was used by young women to defend their virtue or, if they lost it, to take their own life."	4500	Samurai	100	538
The Japanese women, especially the samurai wives, were very respected. They had qualities that made them an important part of Japanese society. They were obedient, self-controlled, loyal, responsible, etc. Wives of rich samurai were very well dressed and enjoyed a good position in society. They did not do any physical work. However, no women were allowed to be involve in politics or warfare.	4500	Samurai	100	394
Of course, there were women who were powerful. For example, in Muromachi period, the wife of Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1449 – 1474, 8th shogun), Hino Tomiko ruled in his place. The Toyotomi Hideyoshi's (1536 – 1598) mistress became the real master of Osaka castle after his death. Yamauchi Kazutoyo's (1545 – 1605) wife, Chiyo, was one of the most loyal wives known in Japanese history. Her power was of another kind, she supported her husband during hard times, saving to buy a horse for him. Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a mistress, though it was a known tradition for samurai, and he never left Chiyo although she was only able to have one child (a girl, Yone).	4500	Samurai	100	658
During Tokugawa Era (1603 – 1867) women's education became very important. Girls were taught to write, read, dance, etc. beginning at a young age. While the main criteria for marriage changed, among the most important were: physical attractiveness and education. Special books were written for women. They mainly taught how to take care of house and children. But, by the end of the Tokugawa period women attended philosophical and literary classes.	4500	Samurai	100	449
A castle is a fortified structure from the Middle Ages that housed and protected people from their enemies. A castle belonged to royalty or nobility. The building was typically made of stone with tall, thick walls due to the kind of warfare of that time.	10072	Castle	100	254
The owner of the castle was a king or lord who ruled the local area and owned the land around it. The peasants (also called serfs) lived on the land and were farmers or artisans. They provided goods and services to the castle ruler in exchange for protection. They could also be drafted to be soldiers either to defend the castle or attack the ruler's enemies.	10072	Castle	100	360
A typical castle had many protective architectural features. The castle's defenders would patrol the rooftop, watching for the approach of attackers. When an attacking force neared, a drawbridge controlled by guards would be lifted. The surrounding moat filled with water prevented anyone getting close enough to the walls for setting up ladders. Soldiers could shoot arrows at attackers on the ground.	10072	Castle	100	402
There were two main ways to attack a castle. One is to lay siege, preventing anyone from going in or coming out so that the people inside would risk starvation. Attacking the castle walls and within required using powerful weapons, such as the catapault, to launch projectiles at or over the walls. Such weapons were used as early as Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.	10072	Castle	100	370
With the passage of centuries, castles are mainly no longer inhabited. Many have fallen into disrepair or even ruin. Because of the historical importance of castles, efforts are made to restore them and maintain them. The expenses are covered by the government or special funds set up for this purpose. They are popular tourist destinations.	10072	Castle	100	341
The Cold War was the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) during the 46-year period following the World War II's end, but before the end of the Soviet Union. It refers to the time between 1945 and 1991. The war was unlike any other war, because the two countries' armies never directly went to war with each other. Many people feared that the relations would end in a nuclear war, but that never happened.	5732	Cold_War	100	441
The United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Australia, West Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands are examples of countries on the American side. East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland were on the Soviet side. Cuba, North Korea, China, Mongolia and numerous other countries were friendly to the Soviets at various times.	5732	Cold_War	100	332
"The outbreak of the Cold War was due to the different ways of thinking - known as ""ideology"" - both in economy and government. The United States used capitalism as their economic and governmental system while the Soviet Union created its own version of socialism. Both countries claimed to be a ""democracy"", but neither one believed each other. These differences led to a tense relationship between the two countries."	5732	Cold_War	100	417
The USSR and the United States were friends during World War II because both countries did not approve of Nazi Germany's ideology, even though the United States' private investors originally gave money to Nazi Germany before the war started. While they were friends, both the USSR and the United States still did not agree with each other in terms of government, but both thought that it was more important to work together fighting against Germany.	5732	Cold_War	100	449
After WWII left Germany in tatters, the Allies split it into four parts. One part was given to the United Kingdom, one part to France, one part to the USSR, and one part to the United States. The Eastern German city Berlin also separated, even though Berlin is located in the Eastern part of Germany, which was the Soviet compartment. The three Western countries compiled their sections of the country together to form a country known as the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland or BRD). The USSR then named their section of Germany the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik or DDR). The Western parts of Berlin were, like the country, placed together to form West Berlin: a BRD enclave inside of the DDR.	5732	Cold_War	100	746
A proxy war is when two powerful countries fight indirectly. There were some proxy wars during the Cold War. For example, when a third world country was in a civil war, the United States might support the army which was anti-communist and the Soviet Union would support the army which was pro-communist. For example, author Michael Lind wrote that the Vietnam War was a proxy war between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which had become a Communist country. The Soviet Union and China worked together to help North Vietnam, while not directly fighting in the war. The United States directly fought in the war against North Vietnam. With both North Korea and South Korea sponsored by external powers, the Korean War was also a proxy war.	5732	Cold_War	100	752
"During the 1950s, there was a ""red scare"" in the United States. During the Cold War many Americans were worried about Communists becoming powerful in the United States. Many Americans were accused of being Communists, especially actors, artists, and political figures. Accusing someone of being a communist was very serious because the United States government told the people that the Communists were the enemy. This was often done as a political attack. Many actors were 'Blackballed' and were not allowed to act in any movies after they were accused of being Communists. The McCarthy Era was a period when many important or powerful Americans were accused of being communists. Most of them were political opponents of McCarthy, who had a powerful position in the government. Many science fiction Hollywood movies were made in the 1950s (such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds and the Day the Earth Stood Still) and a lot of these movies reflected the Red Scare that took place at the time. Typically, aliens from another planet began taking over small towns and the people in them, and turning them into aliens too. The aliens and creatures in these movies reflected communists, and the fear of them taking over."	5732	Cold_War	100	1234
The 1950s were the beginning of a space race between the US and USSR. It began with the USSR putting the Sputnik satellite in space, making the Soviet Union the first country to go into space. They soon sent the first man into space to orbit the Earth, named Yurii Gagarin. The Soviet Union claimed that this proved that socialism was the only way to go into space. The United States responded by starting NASA, and soon sent up its own satellites.	5732	Cold_War	100	448
In the 1950s, the United States (under president Dwight Eisenhower) created a policy called New Look which meant to reduce military defense spending while rapidly increasing the amount of nuclear weapons it had. It was a policy of nuclear deterrence (which means that the United States built so many nuclear weapons, it intimidated the Soviet Union from attacking them).	5732	Cold_War	100	370
"United States Vice-President Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Nikita Khrushchev during the 1950's. One of these was called the ""Kitchen Debate"" because it happened in a kitchen at the World's Fair. These debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the U.S. and the USSR. At the end of the decade, a United States plane which spied on the Soviet Union, called U2, crashed. This was very bad for U.S.-Soviet relations, and the tensions between the two countries increased."	5732	Cold_War	100	504
After the United States tried to invade Cuba and failed, the Soviet Union supplied Cuba with nuclear missiles. The missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviet Union to effectively target almost the entire United States. The United States sent a large amount of ships around Cuba to stop the Soviet Union from delivering them nuclear weapons. The United States and Soviet Union came to agreement that the Soviet Union will no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba as long as the United States does not invade Cuba again. This was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and it was the closest the world was to having a nuclear war, something that would have caused a chain reaction that could have spread around the whole world.	5732	Cold_War	100	727
"This time period began after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, and ended around 1980. The word ""detente"" (pronounced day-tont) means less tension between two countries. In this case, it meant an improved relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. During this time period, as China began to dislike the Soviet Union, the United States built a good relationship with China, giving the Soviet Union a disadvantage during the Cold War. During the 1970s, the United States and the Soviet Union both signed several treaties which reduced the amount of nuclear weapons each country had."	5732	Cold_War	100	597
The policy of détente ended in 1981, when president Ronald Reagan ordered a massive military build-up to challenge the Soviet Union's influence around the world. The United States began to support (by giving money and weapons to them) anti-communists all over the world who wanted to overthrow their communist governments.	5732	Cold_War	100	322
The Soviet Union had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending, but could not. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, and the Soviet Union was having a very difficult time winning against the Taliban, a group trained by the United States to fight against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the United States' failure during the Vietnam War.	5732	Cold_War	100	510
In the late 1980s the new Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix the world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons completely. However, this did not take place because the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, insisted on having a nuclear missile defence system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided on their feelings about this. Some people wanted President Gorbachev to fight harder to nuclear weapons, while others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. These mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political fighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Because of this, leaders of the Soviet Union started to fight against each other, the Communist Party began to crumble and the Soviet Union collapsed.	5732	Cold_War	100	860
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without Communist rule holding the countries that compiled the Soviet Union together, the USSR broke into many smaller countries, like Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Georgia. The nations of Eastern Europe returned to capitalism, and the period of the Cold War was over. The Soviet Union ended in December 1991. (*)	5732	Cold_War	100	360
The Knights of the Round Table were characters in the legends about King Arthur. They were the best knights in King Arthur's kingdom, and lived in King Arthur's castle, Camelot. They were called the Knights of the Round Table because of a special table that was in Camelot, that was round instead of rectangular. This meant that everyone who sat around it was seen as equal.	5743	Knights_of_the_Round_Table	100	374
In order to become a Knight of the Round Table, a knight had to prove he was chivalrous (polite) enough. In the legend, the knights swore a Code of Chivalry, which is much like an oath is today. This meant that they promised to uphold the rules given to them once they became a Knight of the Round Table.	5743	Knights_of_the_Round_Table	100	304
"Frozen is a 3D computer-animated musical movie very loosely based on the fairy tale ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie was released in November 2013 by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Voice actors include Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana."	2448	Frozen	100	298
This is a list of the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. Roman Mythology uses different names, calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter, and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example. The Roman names are often better known to English-speaking people than the Greek names.	4413	List_of_Greek_gods_and_goddesses	100	272
A computer is a machine that changes information according to well defined rules. Computers have existed for much of human history. Examples of early computers are the astrolabe and the abacus. Modern computers have changed very much. They are able to control traffic lights, cars, locks, coffee makers, or anything else electronic. Most modern computers can be used to play music or video. The basic principle is still the same though: the computer has a set of rules, usually called an algorithm. The computer changes information based on these rules.	5744	Computer	100	553
A person uses a computer by telling it to do things, like playing movies or going to Wikipedia. Computers do not know English, so people must tell their computers to do things by speaking the computer's language. The computer's language is called machine code. Programmers can know this computer's language, but they would rather use a programming language. Programmers use it to write programs that tell the computer what to do. Normal people use the programs that a programmer wrote to tell the computer what to do.	5744	Computer	100	517
Computers can do anything that someone can tell them to do. Computers are able to solve mathematical problems because a programmer has told them how to solve math problems. Because computers are very fast, modern computers can solve billions of math problems per second. Computers are used to control factories, which in the past were controlled by humans. They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the news, and writing.	5744	Computer	100	470
"Nobody knows who built the first computer. This is because the word ""computer"" used to mean a person who did math as their job (a human computer). Because of this, some people say that humans were the first computers. Human computers got bored doing the same math over and over again, and made tools (mostly mechanical calculating devices like abacuses) to help them get the answers to their problems.It is said that the inventor of the 'modern' computer was Charles Babbage."	5744	Computer	100	475
"Humans have a problem with math. To show this, try doing 584 x 3,220 in your head. It is hard to remember all the steps! People made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again. A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper. That took a lot of time and people made mistakes. So people made machines that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the ""history of automated calculation,"" which is a fancy phrase for ""the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same math problem over and over without making mistakes."""	5744	Computer	100	717
"Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the ""history of programmable machines"" which is a fancy phrase for ""The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."""	5744	Computer	100	637
One of the first examples of this was built by Hero of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.	5744	Computer	100	369
"Most historians agree that the ""castle clock"", an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, is the first known programmable analog computer. (*) It showed the zodiac, the solar and lunar orbits, a crescent moon-shaped pointer travelling across a gateway that made some doors to open every hour, (*) (*) and five robotic musicians who play music when levers hit them. The length of day and night could be changed (AKA re-programmed) every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year. Some peopleTemplate:who consider Ada Lovelace to be the first programmer.[Source?]"	5744	Computer	100	615
At the end of the Middle Ages, people in Europe thought math and engineering were more important. In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator. Other Europeans made more calculators after him. They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris. Because of this, we say they were not programmable.	5744	Computer	100	418
In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted. This means the loom was programmable.	5744	Computer	100	310
"Modern computers were made when someone (Charles Babbage) had an idea. He wanted to make a machine that could do all the boring parts of math, (like the automated calculators) and could be told to do them different ways (like the programmable machines.) Charles Babbage was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer. He called it the ""The Analytical Engine"". (*) Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine."	5744	Computer	100	528
"As time went on, computers got more and more popular. And that stands out at the beginning. This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over. Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again. The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. People got very bored and very frustrated, and would say, ""There HAS to be an easier way to do this."" Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. Herman Hollerith figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation(which later became IBM) made his machines, and everyone was happy. At least, they were happy until their machines broke down, got jammed, and had to be repaired. This is when the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation invented tech support."	5744	Computer	100	952
In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together. If you remember getting bored doing your times tables, you will know exactly how they felt.	5744	Computer	100	357
Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s. Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them. Here are a few of the computers they built:	5744	Computer	100	280
"Konrad Zuse's electromechanical ""Z machines"". The Z3 (1941) was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic. Binary arithmetic means using ""Yes"" and ""No."" to add numbers together. You could also program it. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be Turing complete. Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer. It is the world's first modern computer."	5744	Computer	100	445
The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory ENIAC (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer (since Konrad Zuse's Z3 of 1941 used electromagnets instead of electronics). At first, however, the only way you could reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.	5744	Computer	100	359
"Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as ""stored program architecture"" or von Neumann architecture. John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time. The first of these was completed in Great Britain. The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or ""Baby""), while the EDSAC, completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—EDVAC—was completed but was not ready for two years."	5744	Computer	100	864
Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form. It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer. Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.	5744	Computer	100	287
In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper. They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on integrated circuits. Microprocessors, such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller and cheaper. They also made computers faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines. The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computer. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household.	5744	Computer	100	716
"In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) ""multimedia computers"" and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, many are now starting to add the smartphone category among ""real"" computers. In 2008, if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, is no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.[Source?]"	5744	Computer	100	414
"A ""desktop computer"" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer). Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called ""desktop computers."" ""Laptop computers"" are computers small enough to fit on your lap. This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games."	5744	Computer	100	456
"There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use. These are called ""Mainframes,"" and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this: the personal computer is like your skin: you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world. A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you (hopefully) never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems."	5744	Computer	100	569
There is another type of computer, called an embedded computer. An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well. For example, an alarm clock is an embedded computer: it tells the time. Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris. Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install programs like Tetris on your clock. Some mobile phones, automatic teller machines, microwave ovens, CD players and cars are examples of embedded computers.	5744	Computer	100	567
"Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as binary symbols (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit, which comes from the words binary digit. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of these instructions is called a program and stored on the computer's hard disk. Computers use memory called ""RAM"" as a space to carry out the instructions and store data while it is doing these instructions. When the computer wants to store the results of the instructions for later, it uses the hard disk."	5744	Computer	100	721
"An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. It tells the electronics inside the computer, or ""hardware"", how to work to get the results it needs. This lets most computers have the same operating system, or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program."	5744	Computer	100	663
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication. Communication is how people share information. Computers have helped people move forward in science, medicine, business, and learning, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other people communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers.	5744	Computer	100	558
A computer is now almost always an electronic device. It usually contains materials that will become toxic waste when disposed of. When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for. This is called product stewardship.	5744	Computer	100	286
Computers can become obsolete quickly, depending on what programs the user runs. Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so computer recycling happens a lot. Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs.	5744	Computer	100	439
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the CPU is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides electricity to the entire computer. The various drives (CD drive, floppy drive, and on many newer computers, USB drive) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The hard drive is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound, which is like vocal cords, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are speakers, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a graphics card, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.	5744	Computer	100	1279
The Internet is a large group of computers that are connected to each other. The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world. It has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks and websites, which together carry many different kinds of information (facts and details) and services. So in other words, the Internet is a network of networks.	5745	Internet	100	405
"at CERN in Switzerland in 1989 by a British (UK) man named Tim Berners-Lee. Today, people can pay money to access the Internet from Internet Service Providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes the people who offer these free services use advertising to make money from them. The alternative (other) name, ""Net"" came from ""Inter(net)""."	5745	Internet	100	362
"The Internet is used for many things, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the ""Web""). The Web contains websites, blogs, and also wikis like Wikipedia. Webpages on the Web can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a password, or it is blocked)."	5745	Internet	100	427
The second major use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one user to another. Instant messaging (such as AIM or ICQ) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster. Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it. For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad. Many times no one in China can read it or add to it. (*) Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see. Well-known examples of the whole Internet being blocked are in North Korea (*) and Myanmar.	5745	Internet	100	622
The Internet can also be a dangerous place. Information that people put on the Internet is not always checked, and some may not be true. Some may even be harmful. Also, if someone sends information through the internet, sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to. For example, Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings. A person can post information on a website, but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing. A good way to check for a secure website is to make sure the URL starts with https:// instead of http://, this means it is a secure site. (This only stops other people from reading what a user types. It does not mean the website is safe)	5745	Internet	100	723
"The Korean War, known in China as the ""War to Resist American Aggressiom and Aid Korea"", and in the DPRK as the ""Korean Liberation War"" was a war fought in Korea between armies from North Korea and from South Korea. The war began on 4:30 AM on June 25, 1950 and fighting stopped July 27, 1953. More than two million Koreans died, most of them in the north."	5751	Korean_War	100	356
Both sides blame each other for starting the war. The north, led by communist Kim Il-Sung, was helped mostly by the People's Republic of China, and the USSR. The south, led by nationalist Syngman Rhee, was helped by many countries in the United Nations, and especially by the United States. The war ended with a truce. South Korea and North Korea are still officially at war, and the United States still keeps troops in South Korea, in case North Korea ever invades again. North and South Korea are divided by the 38th parallel.	5751	Korean_War	100	528
In 1910, Japan put Korea under Japanese rule and was still ruling Korea when World War Two ended. When Japan surrendered, the United States and the USSR agreed to split Korea into two temporary occupation zones with USSR occupying the North and USA occupying the South. This was, at first, to be for a short time.	5751	Korean_War	100	313
At the Moscow Conference of the Council of Foreign Ministers in December 1945, the United States and USSR agreed on Korea having a provisional government (a temporary government set up quickly before a real government is ready). This became difficult because of the growing Cold War (see next cause). (*)	5751	Korean_War	100	304
The Cold War was an important cause in the Korean War. Relations between the two occupying powers were bad and when China became Socialist in October 1949, the President of the USA, Harry Truman, and the American capitalist class were very worried that other countries around China may also become Communist, such as Japan. The American Army was about one twelfth the size of five years earlier (*) and Joseph Stalin had recently lost a Cold War dispute over the Berlin Blockade and subsequent airlift.	5751	Korean_War	100	502
United Nations army intervenes and lands at Inchon, a small port just about half-way down South Korea, from there on they fight the North Korean army and push them past the border separating North and South Korea and close to the Chinese border, just south of the Yalu River.	5751	Korean_War	100	275
The warning given by the Chinese is ignored by the UN (led by an American general, Douglas MacArthur) and so the Chinese army, called the People's Liberation Army, invades North Korea and helps the North Koreans fight the UN until the UN forces are pushed past the border separating North and South Korea.	5751	Korean_War	100	305
"In everyday talk, we say things fall because the Earth's gravity pulls on them. We talk as if our weight was a ""given"". Actually, weight changes when the pull of gravity changes. The Moon is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth. So any object on the Moon weighs 1/6th of its weight on Earth. What does not change is the amount of matter in an object. That is called its mass. On Earth, mass and weight are the same, for practical purposes. The trip to the Moon shows they are not really the same."	5752	Gravity	100	537
In the late 17th century, Galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the Tower of Pisa. He later rolled balls down inclines. With these experiments, Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight.	5752	Gravity	100	274
In 1687, English mathematician Isaac Newton wrote the Principia. In this book, he wrote about the inverse-square law of gravitation. Newton said that the closer two objects are to each other, the more gravity will affect them. His theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet Neptune based on changes in the orbit of Uranus.	5752	Gravity	100	352
Newton's theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than Mercury. When this was done, it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct. These mistakes in his theory were corrected by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Newton's theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of General Relativity and is usually accurate enough for many uses.	5752	Gravity	100	460
Why does the Earth not fall into the Sun? The answer is simple but very important. It is because the Earth moving round the Sun is in a dynamic equilibrium. The speed of the Earth's movement creates a centrifugal force which balances the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth. Why does the Earth continue spinning? Because there is no force to stop it.	5752	Gravity	100	364
In general relativity there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity is seen as changes in the properties of space and time. In turn, this changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. (*) The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.	5752	Gravity	100	415
Gravity influences the passage of time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift.	5752	Gravity	100	272
General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun. (*)	5752	Gravity	100	269
Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. (*) (*)	5752	Gravity	100	287
Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime. They move as a wave, travelling outward from the source. Einstein predicted them in 1915 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. (*) In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation. Sources of detectable gravitational waves might include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. In general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light.	5752	Gravity	100	503
Although gravitational radiation has not been directly detected, there is indirect evidence for its existence. The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system. These measurements suggest gravitational waves are more than mathematical peculiarities. Various gravitational wave detectors exist. However, they have not yet detected the phenomena.	5752	Gravity	100	395
