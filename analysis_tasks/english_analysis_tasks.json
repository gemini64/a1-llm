List all adjective instances, including repeated occurrences.\n\nBe especially careful when analyzing adjectives' regularity:\n- **comparative form**: Regular adjectives form their comparative either by:\n  - Adding 'more' before the positive form (typically for 2+ syllable words, e.g. 'capable' -> 'more capable'). In these cases, the adjective will be directly preceded by 'more' in the provided input. List and analyze them as a single item.\n  - Adding the suffix '-er/r' (typically for 1 syllable words, e.g. 'fast' -> 'faster')\n\n- **superlative form**: Regular adjectives form their superlative either by:\n  - Adding 'most' before the positive form (typically for 2+ syllable words, e.g. 'capable' -> 'most capable'). In these cases, the adjective will be directly preceded by 'most' in the provided input. List and analyze them as a single item\n  - Adding the suffix '-est/st' (typically for 1 syllable words, e.g. 'fast' -> 'fastest')\n\n- **irregular adjectives**: Some adjectives don't follow these patterns. They can be irregular in two ways:\n  1. Complete irregularity: All forms are different (e.g. 'good' -> 'better' -> 'best', 'bad' -> 'worse' -> 'worst')\n  2. Partial irregularity: Using standard suffixes but with stem changes (e.g. 'far' -> 'further' -> 'furthest')\n\n- **edge cases (more/most)**: 'more' and 'most' may also be used on their own as the comparative and superlative irregular forms of 'many/much'. Be extra attentive and check if any other adjective directly follows them or if they are indeed used as standalone.\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.

        "verbs": "Given the following part-of-speech (POS) tagged text:\n```\n{input}\n```\nExtract and analyze ALL the verbs it contains.\n\nBe particularly careful when analyzing auxiliary verbs:\n- **to be/to have**: when used as auxiliary in finite verb forms, they should be listed and analyzed as a single item along with the main verb they accompany (e.g. \"was playing\" should be listed as a \"past continuous\").\n- **modals**: if used as auxiliary, should be listed and analyzed as a single item along with the main verb they accompany (e.g. \"can swim\").\n- **multiple auxiliary verbs**: some verb forms may include multiple auxiliary verbs. This is the case, for example for the \"future perfect continous\", where we have both the modal \"will\" and the verb \"to be\". In cases where multiple auxiliary verbs accompany a main verb, if a modal verb is used, list only the lemma of the modal auxiliary verb (e.g. \"will have been\" should list just \"will\" as auxiliary).\n- **perfect gerunds**: this non-finite verb form is formed by \"having\" + \"past participle\" (this is the main verb). Analyze and list perfect gerunds as a single item (e.g. \"having swum\").\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.
