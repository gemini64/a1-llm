List all noun instances, including repeated occurrences.\n\nBe especially careful when analyzing nouns' regularity:\n- **regular nouns**: regular English nouns follow the following pluralization rules:\n  - **general rule**: add -s to form the plural (e.g. 'book/books')\n  - **nouns ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -z**: add -es (e.g. 'box/boxes', 'church/churches', 'buzz/buzzes')\n  - **nouns ending in consonant + -y**: change the 'y' to 'i' and add '-es' (e.g. 'story/stories')\n  - **nouns ending in vowel + -y**: just add -s (e.g. 'day/days')\n  - **nouns ending in -o**: \n    - after a consonant: usually add '-es' (e.g. 'tomato/tomatoes', 'hero/heroes')\n    - after a vowel: add '-s' (e.g. 'radio/radios', 'studio/studios')\n    - some exceptions exist (e.g. 'piano/pianos', 'photo/photos')\n- **irregular nouns**: irregular English nouns form their plurals in unique ways:\n  - **internal vowel change**: (e.g. 'man/men', 'woman/women', 'foot/feet', 'tooth/teeth')\n  - **-en endings**: (e.g. 'child/children', 'ox/oxen')\n  - **most nouns ending in -f/fe**: replace the 'f/fe' with 'v' and add '-es' (e.g. 'knife/knives', 'leaf/leaves')\n    - exceptions: some -f endings just add -s (e.g. 'roof/roofs', 'chief/chiefs')\n  - **same form**: some nouns have identical singular and plural forms (e.g. 'sheep', 'deer', 'fish')\n  - **foreign origin**: some retain their original language plurals (e.g. 'criterion/criteria', 'phenomenon/phenomena')\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.

This is the case, for example for the \"future perfect continous\", where we have both the modal \"will\" and the verb \"to be\". In cases where multiple auxiliary verbs accompany a main verb, if a modal verb is used, list only the lemma of the modal auxiliary verb (e.g. \"will have been\" should list just \"will\" as auxiliary).\n- **perfect gerunds**: this non-finite verb form is formed by \"having\" + \"past participle\" (this is the main verb). Analyze and list perfect gerunds as a single item (e.g. \"having swum\").\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.
