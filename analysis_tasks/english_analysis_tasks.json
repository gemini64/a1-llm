List all noun instances, including repeated occurrences.\n\nBe especially careful when analyzing nouns' regularity:\n- **regular nouns**: regular English nouns follow the following pluralization rules:\n  - **general rule**: add -s to form the plural (e.g. 'book/books')\n  - **nouns ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -z**: add -es (e.g. 'box/boxes', 'church/churches', 'buzz/buzzes')\n  - **nouns ending in consonant + -y**: change the 'y' to 'i' and add '-es' (e.g. 'story/stories')\n  - **nouns ending in vowel + -y**: just add -s (e.g. 'day/days')\n  - **nouns ending in -o**: \n    - after a consonant: usually add '-es' (e.g. 'tomato/tomatoes', 'hero/heroes')\n    - after a vowel: add '-s' (e.g. 'radio/radios', 'studio/studios')\n    - some exceptions exist (e.g. 'piano/pianos', 'photo/photos')\n- **irregular nouns**: irregular English nouns form their plurals in unique ways:\n  - **internal vowel change**: (e.g. 'man/men', 'woman/women', 'foot/feet', 'tooth/teeth')\n  - **-en endings**: (e.g. 'child/children', 'ox/oxen')\n  - **most nouns ending in -f/fe**: replace the 'f/fe' with 'v' and add '-es' (e.g. 'knife/knives', 'leaf/leaves')\n    - exceptions: some -f endings just add -s (e.g. 'roof/roofs', 'chief/chiefs')\n  - **same form**: some nouns have identical singular and plural forms (e.g. 'sheep', 'deer', 'fish')\n  - **foreign origin**: some retain their original language plurals (e.g. 'criterion/criteria', 'phenomenon/phenomena')\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.

When a modal verb appears without an explicit main verb (e.g., \"I can't, but he can.\"), analyze it as a standalone implied main verb.\n- **modals**: when a modal verb has auxiliary (\"AUX\") function, it should be listed and analyzed as a single unit with the main verb it accompanies (e.g. \"can swim\"). Set the verb's \"modal\" property to true.\n- **multiple auxiliary verbs**: some finite verb form may include multiple auxiliaries. This is the case for some passive verb forms and, as an example, verbs conjugated in \"future perfect continuous\", where we have both the modal \"will\" and the verb \"to be\". When multiple auxiliary verbs accompany a main verb, compile the \"auxiliary\" property as follows:\n    - if a **modal** verb is used, annotate exclusively the lemma of the modal auxiliary verb (e.g. \"will have been\" should list just \"will\" as auxiliary)\n    - in all other cases, annotate the lemmas of the auxiliaries used.\n\n### Handling negation particles\nNegation particles such as \"n't\", \"not\", etc. are NOT separate verbs and should NOT be listed as individual entries. Instead:\n- For contracted forms like \"can't\", \"don't\", \"won't\", etc., analyze the full auxiliary/modal together with its negation as a single unit.\n- Example: \"can't\" should be analyzed as a single entry with:\n  - text: \"can't\"\n  - lemma: \"can\"\n  - modal: true\n  - other properties as appropriate\n\n### Marginal verb constructs\n- **perfect gerund**: this non-finite verb form is formed by [having] + [past participle] (this is the main verb). Analyze and list this construct a single unit (e.g. \"having swum\").\n- **[be going to] + [verb]**: this construct should always be analyzed as a single unit (e.g. \"I'm going to jump\"). Annotate these properties as follows:\n  - **text**: the full construct, as it appears in the input text\n  - **lemma**: the lemma of the [verb] used\n  - **auxiliary**: be going to\n  - **modal**: true\n  - **tense and mood**:\n    - when used as **is/are going to**: present continuous\n    - when used as **was/were going to**: past continuous\n- **[be able to/have to/be to/had better] + [verb]**: these marginal verb forms are referred as semi-modals or semi-auxiliaries. These constructs should always be analyzed as a single unit (e.g. \"I have to go\"). Annotate these properties as follows:\n  - **text**: the full construct, as it appears in the input text\n  - **lemma**: the lemma of the [verb] used\n  - **auxiliary**: [be able to/have to/be to/had better]\n  - **modal**: true\n\n### Handling verbs in marginal constructs\nWhen analyzing marginal verb constructs such as [be going to] + [verb], [be able to] + [verb], [have to] + [verb], etc.:\n- The entire construct should be analyzed as a single unit ONLY\n- DO NOT analyze the main verb as a separate infinitive\n- DO NOT analyze \"going\" as a separate gerund/participle when it appears in the [be going to] construction\n- Example: In \"I am going to swim\", only analyze \"am going to swim\" as a single unit, with no separate entries for \"going\" or \"swim\"\n  \n## Output format\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.
