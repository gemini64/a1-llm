This is the case, for example for the \"future perfect continous\", where we have both the modal \"will\" and the verb \"to be\". In cases where multiple auxiliary verbs accompany a main verb, if a modal verb is used, list only the lemma of the modal auxiliary verb (e.g. \"will have been\" should list just \"will\" as auxiliary).\n- **perfect gerunds**: this non-finite verb form is formed by \"having\" + \"past participle\" (this is the main verb). Analyze and list perfect gerunds as a single item (e.g. \"having swum\").\n\nRespond with a structured JSON array conforming to the schema attached below.
